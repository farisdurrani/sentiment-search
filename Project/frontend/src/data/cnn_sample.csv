That’s the way the joke would open, pairing the most unlikely of canine partners – the short legged, long bodied dachshund with the larger, stronger pit bull. But  Rami is proof that the match has happened. “It is a true pit bull head on a dachshund body,” said Dawn Blanton of the Moultrie-Colquitt County Humane Society in south Georgia. A man found the dog, now named Rami, wandering in his backyard. He called the shelter and described him as a “pit bull with short legs,”  Blanton told CNN affiliate WALB. Local animal control officials confirmed that Rami is a dachshund/pit bull mix. “Hi! I’m Rami and I’m looking for my forever home. I’m full of energy. I don’t like walking on a leash,” reads a posting on the animal shelter’s Facebook page. ” I’m a sweetie pie, and love to run. I don’t listen very well, so you’ll need to take some time to train me. Because I tend to be a bit hyper, I might not be the best addition to a household with little kids. But I’m sure that all I need is a little lovin.” And with that posting and others, Rami has become a social media sensation. “We posted a photo of him when he became available. And within a day it went to 1 million hits. And by that night it was up to 2 million. And now it is over 2.4 million hits,” Blanton said. Humane society workers are taking their time to pick his new owner because they don’t want him to become a freak show. “It will be a pretty tough test for people that are wanting this dog. They’re going to have to answer questions, we’re going to do follow-up inspections on him,” said Don Flowers, also of the Humane Society. The Humane Society is hoping Rami’s newfound star status will bring attention to other animals on the county’s Facebook page – there are dogs Brutus and Oreo, as well as Loki and Mari the cats, along with others. Rami, who is fully grown at 25 pounds, is neutered. He is expected to be adopted by next week. Man reunites with stolen dog during search for new pet",2014,Andreas Preuss,0.035,0.865,0.1,0.9778
1,1,01/31/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/30/us/ohio-execution-drugs/index.html,Ohio to delay 7 executions while searching for new drugs,US,CNN,"Ohio will delay the executions of seven death row inmates while searching for an adequate supply of drugs that complies with its new execution protocol, the state’s Department of Rehabilitation and Correction said Friday. That means the state will not carry out any executions in 2015, the agency said in a press release. Ohio said in early January that it will add thiopental sodium, a drug the state used for lethal injections from 1999-2011, the department said. Thiopental sodium and pentobarbital will be the only drugs used. Ohio decided to stop using the two-drug regimen of midazolam and hydromorphone. That drug combination was last used in January 2014 on convicted murderer Dennis McGuire. Witnesses said he convulsed and gasped about 10 minutes before he died. The McGuire execution was closely watched because midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller, had never been used in a U.S. execution. Ohio, like many states, was forced to find new execution drugs after European-based manufacturers banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions – among them, Danish-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital. The executions of Ronald R. Phillips, Raymond Tibbetts, Gregory Lott, Warren K. Henness, William Montgomery, Robert Van Hook and Jeffrey A. Wogenstahl were rescheduled, according to the state.",1338,Ralph Ellis,0.101,0.879,0.02,-0.9595
2,2,01/30/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/30/us/nfl-commissioner-goodell/index.html,NFL Commissioner Goodell: ‘It’s been a tough year’,US,CNN,"NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell acknowledged Friday that “it’s been a tough year” for him and his league after months’ worth of news about everything from allegedly abusive players to ongoing concerns about concussions to deflated footballs. But it was also one, he insisted, marked by significant progress on several fronts. “We’ve all done a lot of soul-searching, starting with yours truly,” Goodell said. “And we have taken action.” The commissioner made these remarks during his “state of the league,” given each season on the eve of the Super Bowl. This Sunday’s matchup is between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks. The NFL is the most popular professional sport in the United States, which makes the spotlight on it that much brighter. On Friday, Goodell touched on a number of subjects, from instant replay to extra points to a possible franchise in Los Angeles. But he couldn’t get away from issues that have dogged his office – chief among them how the NFL handles allegations of domestic violence by players. Goodell said the NFL wasn’t where it needed to be in August, when then-Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice became the center of controversy after video surfaced showing him hitting his then-fiancée. This case came on top of several others – from child abuse accusations against Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson to an assault case against Carolina Panthers defensive star Greg Hardy – that had some demanding that the commissioner resign. He gave no indication Friday he would do any such thing, even after what he called “a year of … humility and learning.” “We obviously as an organization have gone through adversity, but more importantly it’s been adversity for me,” Goodell said. “And that is something where we take that seriously. It’s an opportunity for us to get better. It’s an opportunity for us, for our organization, to get better.” For the first time, the commissioner also addressed what’s been dubbed Deflategate, which relates to the use of underinflated footballs in the first half of the New England Patriots’ AFC Championship win over the Indianapolis Colts. As information leaked out about the situation, some suggested strict punishments for New England – from large fines to suspensions to kicking the team out of the Super Bowl. But the Patriots have fired back, with coach Bill Belichick denying wrongdoing and suggesting science could explain the air pressure issue and owner Bob Kraft suggesting the NFL may owe Belichick and Patriots quarterback Tom Brady an apology if its investigation finds no wrongdoing. What the heck is Deflategate anyway? The commissioner made no apologies Friday for the league’s handling of the case, saying, “This is my responsibility to protect the integrity of the game.” He’s tapped Ted Wells to lead an external investigation into the issue. “I represent 32 teams,” he added. “… And if we have any information where the potential is that those rules were violated, I have to pursue that, and I have to pursue that aggressively.” That investigation is focusing on two main questions, according to Goodell: “Why were some footballs used in the game that were not in compliance with the rules, and was this result of deliberate action?” He added, “I want to emphasize – we have made no judgments on these points. And we will not compromise the investigation by engaging in speculation.”",3390,Greg Botelho,0.108,0.776,0.116,0.5005
3,3,01/30/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/29/us/dog-reunion-canada/index.html,Man reunites with stolen dog during search for new pet,US,CNN,"Deciding to move on after his beloved German shepherd was stolen from his backyard 18 months ago wasn’t easy for Richard Brower. “I never gave up hope,” Brower said, “I’d just come to the realization that I couldn’t go on without another dog.” He’d enlisted the help of his motorcycle-riding buddies and nearly everyone from the dog park in the search.  Anyone seen walking a German shepherd had been, at one time, accosted by him or his friends.  His searches were fruitless. “It was heartbreaking,” Brower said.  “Absolutely horrible.” His heart-wrenching decision to search for a new dog – made after a year-and-a-half of endless searching for Dozer – turned out to be the best decision he could’ve made, as it led him back to his best friend in a miraculous way. “It’s the closest thing to a miracle in my life,” he said. Brower typed “German shepherds for sale” into an Internet browser, which led him first to Claresholm Animal Rescue Society.  He clicked the link and shivers went down his spine. “My heart stopped,” Brower said,  “the second I opened the page.” Staring back at him on the rescue’s website was his dog, Dozer, the pup’s head cocked to the side, just as he remembered. Brower said he never doubted that it was his dog, but he sent the picture to his mom and sister for their opinion.  His sister agreed it was Dozer, but his mom was doubtful.  Brower said she was likely trying to save her son from unnecessary heartbreak, in case it wasn’t him. Brower called the shelter and reached Sylvia Giroux at Claresholm, Alberta.  While on the phone, Brower’s dad, returning home from a business trip, stopped at the shelter, unbeknownst to his son. Brower said Dozer immediately started wagging his tail when his father came into the room.  Still on the phone, Brower instructed his dad to snap his fingers once and then tell him what the dog did. He snapped and Dozer, a super well-trained dog who knows how to open and close doors and turn on lights, circled Brower’s dad and sat on his right hand side, waiting for his next command. “There was no boo-hooing, but it was close,” Giroux said, “It was just such a wonderful thing.” Giroux might’ve kept it together, but Brower said everyone else was a different story. “My dad was bawling, I was bawling on the phone,” he said. And when Dozer got home – there was more crying – from Dozer. “He almost knocked me over,” Brower said. “He came flying in, put his head into my arm and started doing that wailing that German shepherds do.” Other than his having lived at the shelter for a month after he was picked up by a resident nearby, Brower doesn’t know much about Dozer’s whereabouts during the 18 months he was missing.  He’s just thrilled to have his pup, who he calls a “big sweet baby,” back at home, back to normal. Normal, except for at the dog park, where families used to steer clear of the 125-pound pooch. “Now that he’s a celebrity, everyone wants to hug him,” Brower said.

Five teenage males have been arrested, four of them juveniles who attend public schools in the Denver suburb of about 30,000 people, police said. The girl who said she was assaulted is an Englewood High School freshman, school district spokeswoman Julie McGinley said. Police said they’re looking for a sixth juvenile who also goes to Englewood schools. The teenage girl reported being sexually assaulted January 25 at a house party involving alcohol and marijuana that was attended by 10-12 people, Englewood police said. “If your student was at this party, knows someone who was there, or knows of students who have been affected by this event, we have counselors and other trusted adults should they need support or need to share their feelings,” Superintendent Brian Ewert said in a letter sent to parents. “We also ask that you be available to listen to your student and talk to him or her about his or her feelings regarding this event.” Police identified only one suspect, Daylon Benjamin Hill, 19, of Englewood. He was charged with five counts, including sexual assault and sex assault on a child. He is being held on $50,000 bond. Police didn’t identify the others because they are juveniles. Of those, two are 16 years old and two are 15 years old. Officers started looking for the girl late Sunday night after taking a missing juvenile report, police said. About the same time, other officers contacted the girl after she called relatives to say she had been sexually assaulted, police said. A medical examination revealed “significant trauma consistent with sexual assault,” according to a statement attached to Hill’s arrest warrant",1786,Ana Cabrera,0.115,0.842,0.042,-0.9715

The video of three gunman scenarios is so vivid that the authorities posted an online advisory of how “this video contains graphic content of a violent nature. Viewer discretion is advised,” the sheriff’s office said. The more-than-nine-minute video shows what appears to be blood splatter, actors being shot, and the gunman committing suicide when confronted by a tactical team in a classroom with cowering students. The “Surviving An Active Shooter” video took two years to produce and shows three vignettes inspired by true life events, according to the sheriff’s department. The sheriff’s office didn’t specify those events. Mass shootings are typically over after 15 minutes or so, and most of them end before police arrive. “Unlike other videos that are seen on YouTube and other social media websites, the goal of this LASD video presentation is to illustrate very realistic portrayals of these rare, but violent attacks,” the sheriff’s office said. “LASD’s use of special effects and realistic scenarios draw the viewer’s attention to personally connect with the true life portrayals,” the agency said. The video provides advice and guidance to civilians on how to save their lives and those of others through “cover and concealment, location awareness, and self-defense.”",1488,Michael Martinez,0.057,0.859,0.085,0.6428

7,7,01/29/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/29/us/air-force-one/index.html,New Air Force One will carry a powerful legacy,US,CNN,"Imagine putting wings on the White House and getting it to fly around the world. It’s been done. That’s basically Air Force One in a nutshell. Now the Pentagon has announced the next generation of this world-class icon will be a military version of the 747-8. For nearly 30 years, the current jumbo jet Air Force One has been a customized version of the 747-200B. The newer 747-8 is longer and more efficient than its older brother. Why is a new one necessary? “It is time to upgrade,” Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James said in a statement Wednesday. The difference between the civilian version and what the President will fly on: the commander in chief gets a plane that’s tricked out with top-of-the-line parts and backup systems. And a lot of technology that’s – well – classified. Related: What’s new about the 747-8? Let’s remind ourselves why the world is so fascinated with this flying technological marvel. For more than half a century, passengers aboard the U.S. presidential aircraft have been witness to American history. Consider the fact that all these things happened on an Air Force One: – President Kennedy’s body was flown to Washington for burial. – Lyndon Johnson was sworn in as president. – LBJ let a reporter interview him in the plane’s stateroom, while dressed only in a towel. – The only woman ever to swear-in a U.S. president did so aboard Air Force One. – President Richard Nixon became the first American president to visit China, where he historically opened the door to U.S.-Chinese relations. – Air Force One served as President George W. Bush’s command center during the first hours following the 9/11 attacks. One of the main goals for the new plane, the Air Force said, will be affordability. Although the plane is designed to be more fuel efficient than its predecessor a new 747-8 lists for around $368 million. Add all the presidential bells and whistles and the sticker price goes north rather quickly. The 747-8 is made in the U.S., which the Air Forced hinted was a plus. “The Boeing 747-8 is the only aircraft manufactured in the United States (that), when fully missionized, meets the necessary capabilities,” Wednesday’s statement said. The four-engine Airbus A380 – the world’s largest airliner – which is made in France, was thought by some to be Boeing’s only competition for Air Force One. When will the President get a new jumbo jet? Hard to say. If everything goes smoothly, Boeing likely will work with the Air Force on hammering out a timeframe and production schedule. In December, Boeing had 36 unfilled orders for 24 passenger versions and 12 freighter models. From humble beginnings as a small, less than impressively outfitted plane during the FDR administration, to its current jumbo jet status, Air Force One has become a world-class icon representing power and privilege. Members of Congress, celebrities and advocates clamor for seats on it, to get rare access to the President – arguably the most powerful person on the planet. The plane’s well-known blue and white color scheme was largely created by legendary industrial designer Raymond Loewy and approved by JFK himself. Officially, the aircraft is only called Air Force One while a sitting president is aboard. The presidential fleet includes several aircraft, other than the two 747s, that from time to time carry the “Air Force One” call sign. The presidential helicopter is operated by the Marine Corps and is often seen ferrying the President to and from the South Lawn of the White House. It’s called “Marine One.” On the rare occasion the President travels by Army aircraft, that is known as “Army One.” By the same logic, aircraft used to carry the vice president are given the call sign “Air Force Two.” Over the years, the various “Air Force Ones” have had their fair share of Hollywood screen roles. For example, the technological wizardry onboard the present 747s got wide play in the 1997 Harrison Ford action movie “Air Force One,” in which the President’s jet is hijacked by Russian nationalists. However, many of the more outlandish gizmos featured in the film owed more to, shall we say, artistic license than to airborne fact. The plane for example has no escape pod. Nor is it equipped with parachutes – the massive slipstream created by an aircraft the size of a 747 means they can’t be used. Designed to operate as independently as possible from ground services, the aircraft can fly halfway around the world without refueling. They carry their own automated baggage loaders as well as built-in front and aft stairs enabling them to operate self-sufficiently at airports and airfields around the world, minimizing security risks. Capable of in-flight refueling from airborne tankers, manufacturers say the aircraft has “virtually unlimited range” – its passengers sustained by galleys capable of storing up to 2,000 meals at a time. The entire aircraft is shielded against the effects of electromagnetic pulse – a wave of energy generated by the detonation of a nuclear device that can disable unprotected electronics. It  features private accommodation, office space and a workout room for the President, first lady and family; as well as accommodation and offices for support staff and security personnel. Also on board is a stateroom and conference rooms that can, should it ever be necessary, be converted into a fully functional airborne medical center.",5399,Thom Patterson,0.018,0.915,0.067,0.9906

United Flight 1181, a Boeing 757 that was flying from Los Angeles to Washington, had to divert to Ontario International Airport, said Ian Gregor, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration. The flight, with 199 passengers and seven crew members, landed safely. “We had to make an emergency landing in Ontario CA today after we smelled smoke and they discovered a small fire in the fuselage,” said Instagram user Todd Palmerton, a passenger on the plane. “Our pilot was incredible, but it’s pretty nerve racking having to text your wife that you love her while the pilot flys a 777 like its a navy fighter jet.” Another passenger, Allen Hill wrote on Facebook that there was a “slight smell of smoke inside and a hot spot detected in the fuselage from the exterior.” Hill said the Ontario fire department had to hose down the airliner’s brakes, which overheated during the fast, hard landing. Twitter user Mitchell Hashimoto also praised the pilot, saying the captain handled the emergency “super fast and professionally.” The plane was at about 28,400 feet when it began its descent, which actually took about 15 minutes, according to the flight tracking website FlightAware. United didn’t confirm there was a fire on board, saying the plane diverted because of a burning smell. “Our maintenance team is reviewing the aircraft, and we’re working as quickly as possible to get our customers to Washington, D.C.,” the airline said.

9,9,01/29/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/28/us/annapolis-fire/index.html,Dry Christmas tree fueled Annapolis mansion fire that killed 6,US,CNN,"An electrical failure ignited a dry,15-foot-tall Christmas tree in a fire that destroyed an Annapolis, Maryland, mansion, killing four children and their grandparents, Anne Arundel County fire officials said Wednesday. Technology executive Don Pyle; his wife, Sandra; and four grandchildren died in what Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agent Bill McMullan called “a tragic accident that occurred at the worst possible time while the Pyles and their grandchildren were sleeping.” “The involvement of the Christmas tree explains the heavy fire conditions,” Fire Chief  Allan Graves said at a news conference. The grandchildren have been identified as Alexis (Lexi) Boone, 8; Kaitlyn (Katie) Boone, 7; Charlotte Boone, 8; and Wesley (Wes) Boone, 6. They were the children of Sandra Pyle’s sons, Randy and Clint Boone. “While the explanation that has been shared with us today does not bring solace, it does start us down the long road to acceptance,” a statement Wednesday from the Boone and Pyle families said. “Our tragedy has touched many lives in many families, and, in different degrees, is shared by each of us.  Our hope is that our loss will raise awareness that this tragic event could happen to any family. “ The blaze started in the waterfront mansion’s great room, with 19-foot ceilings and connections to living and sleeping areas. It was fed by a towering Christmas tree that was cut about two months earlier, fire officials said. The tree was lit most of the time, officials said. “The fuel load from the Christmas tree itself is what created the significant amount of fire and heat to cause the fire to spread as quickly as it did,” Deputy Chief Scott Hoglander said. Authorities were alerted within minutes by a fire-alarm system monitored outside the home and a neighbor’s 911 call. The home, which was constructed before 2005 legislation requiring a sprinkler system, did not have the devices. “We’re very comfortable that this was an accidental fire,” Graves said. The medical examiner’s office positively identified the victims, officials said. Five bodies were recovered in the days after the fire; the final one on Monday. The children were visiting their grandparents for a sleepover because Monday was a school holiday, a family spokeswoman said. “We believe that life is about making memories.  As we work through our pain and loss, the memories we made with our family will sustain us,” the families’ statement said. Officials said they were still conducting tests to determine the exact sequence of events, but believe the fire was sparked by a faulty electrical outlet. Smoke detectors in homes are common but fire sprinklers are not, says the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Fire sprinklers reduce the death rate by 83%, property damage by 69% and firefighter injuries by 65%. Fires in homes are responsible for more than 80% of fire deaths in the United States, according to the agency. Christmas tree fires are three times more deadly than home fire in general, according to the National Fire Protection Association. Local and federal officials last week secured the structure and accessed the foundation of the 16,000-square-foot house. Cadaver dogs led them to the bodies, officials said. Authorities were initially treating the house as a crime scene. Officials said it is standard procedure for a case such as this and no evidence has been found to indicate suspicious activity. The house belonged to Pyle, chief operating officer for ScienceLogic, company spokesman Antonio Piraino said. The sheer size of the structure and the fact that three-fourths of the building had collapsed into the basement, with deep piles of  debris still smoldering days after the blaze, compounded the search, Anne Arundel County Fire Capt. Robert Howarth said. He led the investigation along with a team from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. “You’re looking at five standard houses put together,” he said Tuesday. “This is more of a commercial fire than it is a residential fire. There are a lot of businesses that aren’t 16,000 square feet. That adds to it.” Fire officials said they were alerted to the fire about 3:30 a.m. Monday. About 80 firefighters responded. The ATF national response team responded because the fire was deemed suspicious, Howarth said. The fire department said crews had difficulty putting out the fire because the house is secluded, apparently with no fire hydrants on the scene. Photos the fire department posted on Twitter showed hoses stretched for long distances. Davies said it took hours for fire department tanker trucks and a fire boat on an adjacent creek to bring the fire under control. Pyle’s company biography described him as an industry veteran who has held multiple CEO positions, with more than 25 years’ experience in information technology infrastructure software and hardware management.",4906,Ray Sanchez,0.153,0.813,0.034,-0.9983

Jennifer Bruno knew the blizzard battering New England might be brutal. So as the storm hit, she spent Monday night at a friend’s house. When she returned to her coastal home in Marshfield, Massachusetts, Tuesday, she discovered a devastating scene. Rocks were everywhere, she said. “Part of the roof collapsed, the wall, my door was missing,” she told CNN’s AC360. “It was just destroyed.” The Massachusetts National Guard sergeant and Iraq war veteran cried when she caught the first glimpse of what happened. Then she went back inside to get her uniforms, a sword she got in Iraq and a cross with scripture on it that once hung on her wall. “I’ve been through a lot, and that was just more than I thought would have happened,” she said. “(I’ll) just take it one day at a time.” As crews started surveying storm damage and clearing streets, officials warned that the potential for record-setting snowfall remains as stormy weather wallops New England. But Bruno and other residents of coastal areas faced another more menacing threat: storm surge flooding. On Massachusetts’ South Shore, the ocean roared inland to flood the Brant Rock Esplanade, lined with homes and businesses. Marshfield’s police department posted a photo of what it called a “major seawall breach (that) caused structural damage” to an unoccupied home. Authorities in neighboring Duxbury showed a deck blown yards away from a home. And not far away in Scituate, slushy ice, seawater and debris clogged streets as waves came crashing toward shore. In Boston, where about 2 feet of snow had fallen, the city’s mayor said there was still work to be done. “We’re not out of this yet. We’re trying to get ahead of it,” Mayor Marty Walsh said. “We just keep plowing.” The hardest-hit area – Auburn, Massachuetts – got 32.5 inches of snow. And it hasn’t stopped yet. “This is a very significant storm, and in many parts of Massachusetts, I think, you could call it, in fact, a historic event,” Gov. Charlie Baker told reporters. Massachusetts wasn’t the only state getting hit hard Tuesday. The National Weather Service also reported about 20 inches of snow in Portland, Maine; 32 inches in Hudson, New Hampshire; and 30 inches in Orient on New York’s Long Island. On the northern edge of the storm in Maine, Rockland resident Steve DePasa said at 1 p.m. that up to 15 inches of snow was already on the ground, and “we’re expected to get another 10 inches.” So what can you do in the meantime, besides pray that the power stays on? “It’s just go out and clean up a little bit so you can,” said DePasa, a CNN iReporter. “Then wait a few hours and do it again.” The good news? Most people seemed to have heeded the warnings about the storm, which was forecast as “crippling” and “potentially historic,” by stocking up and staying off the roads. If you go through this every year, after all, there’s a good chance you’ll know the drill. “During these storms, everybody has to hunker down and just be safe,” said Bob Connors from Plum Island, on Massachusetts’ North Shore. “We’ve become pretty proficient at that.” As the storm approached, Marge Winski hoped for the best. It’s not the first time she’s braced for bad weather as the caretaker of a lighthouse in Montauk, New York. Riding out Superstorm Sandy was terrifying, she said. This storm, which packed powerful winds, also had it’s scary moments, she said. “I was just praying I didn’t get sick, or the roof didn’t blow off,” she said. “What was I going to do? You know no one’s coming to get you.” But Winski, like many residents of New York and New Jersey, was breathing a sigh of relief on Tuesday. A day earlier, officials warned the storm could turn 58 million people’s lives upside down. Seven states, from New Jersey to New Hampshire, declared states of emergency. School was canceled. Public transit shut down. Businesses closed, suggesting a far-reaching economic impact in one of America’s busiest commercial regions. But by midmorning, snow wasn’t even falling in New York City. By then, travel bans in New Jersey and New York – even places like Long Island’s Islip, which got more than 20 inches of snow – had been lifted. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called all the warning and preparations “a better-safe-than-sorry scenario.” “We’ve dodged the bullet,” he said. “This is nothing like we feared it would be.” But for some in the state, the storm proved dangerous. A 17-year-old died after he hit something while snow-tubing Monday night in Huntington, New York, Suffolk County’s Tim Sini said. An 83-year-old man who suffered from dementia was found frozen to death in his backyard in the same Long Island county. The forecast even improved for Boston. Once expected to see up to 30 inches of snow, Logan International Airport had received 24.4 inches by midnight Tuesday. Still, 2 feet of snow isn’t anything to scoff at. Just ask all those who had their cars snowed in, their front doors blocked and their backyards littered with branches Tuesday. “The worst part is the steady winds, I think they were approaching 50 mph,” said Nantucket Police Chief William Pittman. The entire island, where 15,000 people live, lost power during the storm. But that didn’t stop the doctors and nurses at Nantucket Cottage Hospital, where Cayden Keith Moore was born at the height of the blizzard early Tuesday. As she cradled her newborn boy, mom Danielle Smith said she was doing well, thanks to the generator keeping the hospital warm. “It’s definitely better to be here than at home with no power,” she said. If you’re trying to escape this wintry mess quickly, don’t count on it. Traffic crawled on everything from side roads to highways – including the Massachusetts Turnpike, which was closed to traffic as of early Tuesday afternoon – and many public transit systems shut down. More than 4,700 flights in and out of the United States had been canceled as of 8 p.m. Tuesday, the flight-tracking website Flightaware.com reported. That’s on top of 2,800 scrubbed Monday. Hundreds more have already been called off for Wednesday. Amtrak was also affected, suspending Northeast Regional and Acela Express services between New York and Boston for Tuesday because of the weather. What to know if you’re traveling The storm warnings seemed to impress even the most jaded Northeasterner, as groceries flew off store shelves from Brooklyn to Bangor. Still, it’s not like everyone was shaking in their snow boots. As Steve Nogueira, a retired meteorologist who lives in Taunton, Massachusetts, said, “We’ve done it before.” In the coastal city of Portsmouth, New Hampshire, hundreds accepted a Facebook invitation to a community snowball fight – one that organizer Devin Murphy joked is in the proud tradition dating back to around 1624, when the city was first settled. Fresh off snowblowing his driveway, Jim Robins estimated about 2 feet of light, fluffy snow had fallen outside his home in Dover, New Hampshire. That’s hardly a dusting, but it’s also not surprising when you live in New England. “Sure, that’s a lot, but I have tons of family in Buffalo and they were dealing with 6-10 feet of (snow) at the start of the season,” Robins said. “…We will weather this like the New Englanders we are.”",7232,Greg Botelho,0.09,0.835,0.075,-0.9542

Grab a shovel: It’s pretty much done snowing in the Northeast; now it’s time to dig out.  Eastern Massachusetts bore the brunt of the storm.  Boston’s Logan International Airport got more than 2 feet of snow.  In Auburn and Worcester, the total topped 30 inches.  Most of the travel restrictions have been dropped across the region.  The blizzard warnings are gone.  A few days of digging out and things should be pretty much back to normal. Hindsight: The Blizzard of 2015 didn’t turn out to be as epic as we were first led to believe.  Sure, some parts of Massachusetts got 30-plus inches of snow, but New York City dodged a good bit of the storm, and so did a lot of other areas.  Parts of the Northeast were so underwhelmed it prompted the hashtag #snowFail.  The really sarcastic folks have opted for the term “snowperbole.”  It’s defined as “exaggerated statements or claims about snowfall amounts that aren’t meant to be taken seriously.”  While some say forecasters “cried wolf,” New York Mayor Bill de Blasio says “better safe than sorry.” Deadly attack: The Libyan branch of the Islamic State has taken credit for yesterday’s attack on the Corinthia Hotel in Tripoli.  The attack left 10 dead including one American, one French citizen, three people from Tajikistan, five Libyans. The two attackers also died.  An online group that supports ISIS said the attack was carried out in the name of Abu Anas al-Libi.  Al-Libi was an alleged al Qaeda operative accused of involvement in the bombing of U.S. embassies in Africa.  He was captured by U.S. special forces in Libya. He died in a U.S. hospital this month. Another threat: A video file posted online yesterday is supposed to relay a new message from Japanese ISIS hostage Kenji Goto: He and a captive Jordanian military pilot will be killed in the next 24 hours if Jordan doesn’t release a convicted would-be suicide bomber.  It is the second purported message from Goto in four days. If authentic, it is the first time ISIS is publicly linking the fates of Goto and the captive Jordanian pilot, Moaz al-Kassasbeh, whom ISIS captured after his jet crashed last month in Syria.  In the ISIS proposal, Goto would go free if Jordan releases longtime prisoner Sajida al-Rishawi. Who ya gonna call?: This time it will be girl Ghostbusters who deal with those pesky poltergeists.

12,12,01/28/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/28/us/south-carolina-friendship-nine-sit-in-convictions-vacated/index.html,Judge in S.C. tosses sit-in convictions for Friendship Nine,US,CNN,"A South Carolina judge on Wednesday threw out the convictions of the Friendship Nine, who were jailed in 1961 after a sit-in protest in Rock Hill, South Carolina, during the civil rights movement. “Today is a victory in race relations in America,” said Bernice King, daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., said in a news conference following the ruling. “It is a new day.” The prosecutor who pushed for this momentous day, 16th Circuit Solicitor Kevin Brackett of Rock Hill, cited King’s father when explaining to CNN on Tuesday why he was motivated to take up the cause of the Friendship Nine: “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.” How Friendship Nine ended up back in court The proceedings began at the Rock Hill Law Center with Municipal Judge Jane Pittman Modla reading from the original court record for each of the men. She asked each of the seven men in attendance – one has since died, while another had transportation issues – to stand as their names were called. “Offense: trespassing. Disposition: guilty. Sentence: $100 or 30 days. Condition: sent to the chain gang,” she said for each of them, reading from the 1961 docket. Retired state Supreme Court Justice Ernest Finney, who was the men’s defense attorney in 1961, entered the motion to have the sentences tossed out. The 83-year-old required help standing and propped himself on the table in front of him as he spoke. “May it please the court, today I’m honored and proud to move this honorable court to vacate the conviction of my clients. These courageous and determined South Carolinians have shown by their conduct and their faith that the relief that they seek should be granted. I move for the convictions entered in 1961 to be vacated.” Brackett joked that he would probably be best served letting Finney’s moving argument stand, but he was compelled to say why he agreed with him. One of the reasons is that the Friendship Nine deserved a “heartfelt apology,” which Brackett delivered on behalf of the state. He went on to say, “The record is abundantly clear: There’s only one reason these men were arrested. There was only one reason that they were charged and convicted for trespassing, and that is because they were black. This could not happen today. It was wrong then. It was wrong today. These convictions, if they are allowed to stand, would be an offense to justice, and they must be vacated.” Brackett closed by calling the men “my heroes” and extended his appreciation for their bravery: “Our community here and our country is a better place because of what y’all did. … It’s a better place for me, and it’s a better place for my daughter, and for that, I owe you my thanks.” When Circuit Court Judge John C. Hayes III, the nephew of the judge who sentenced these largely unsung civil rights heroes almost 5½ decades ago, announced that the convictions and sentences were officially vacated, the 250 people in the courtroom broke into a 20-second standing ovation. Another 250 spectators looked on in two overflow rooms within the courthouse. Many of those in attendance were old enough to have lived through the civil rights movement. Prior to the proceedings, Rock Hill Mayor Doug Echols told the crowd that the actions of the Friendship Nine that day “is what courage looks like when good people step forward to lead.” Leaning on a quote from Robert F. Kennedy, who was attorney general at the time of the protests and arrests, Echols said, “Few of us will have the greatness to be in history, as the Friendship Nine have done, but each of us can work to change a small portion of events within our own actions and, by example, touch the lives of others so that in the total of all of those acts, it will be confirmed and recorded that justice is for all people, and that injustice must not be tolerated in any place at any time.” The men, named after the Rock Hill, South Carolina, college that eight of them attended, were looking to make a statement about the plight of the segregated South. And that’s just what they did. Lunch-counter protests had become the cause célèbre the year before, in 1960, just two hours up the road in Greensboro, North Carolina. African-Americans, many of them students, sought to break the barrier of segregated lunch counters by sitting in “white-only” sections. On the morning of January 31, 1961, just after 11 a.m., the Friendship Nine arrived at McCrory’s 5-10-25 Cent Variety Store in downtown Rock Hill. They took their seat at the lunch counter and were promptly arrested for trespassing by police who had caught wind of the men’s plan and were already at the store waiting for them. As the lunch-counter sit-ins spread from Greensboro to other parts of the South, protesters were arrested and charged. Civil rights groups had to pay the mounting bails and fines that the protesters were incurring. The men of Friendship College wondered whether paying fines and bail – to the very people who were oppressing them, no less – was the best course of action. Rather than pay the $100 for their release, the men felt they could make a more profound statement by accepting the full punishment for trespassing: 30 days of hard labor. The strategy, known as “jail, no bail,” would become a popular strategy in the civil rights movement",5299,Devon M. Sayers,0.075,0.778,0.147,0.998

Ronnie “Jay” Adrian Towns, 28, also was charged with armed robbery, the Telfair County Sheriff’s Office said on its website. A judge denied bail for Towns, who also waived his right to a preliminary hearing. After Towns’ initial appearance, reporters shouted questions as he was led from the courthouse, but the suspect remained silent. The victims were shot in the head, police said. Elrey “Bud” Runion, 69, and his wife, June, 66, had driven three and a half hours from an Atlanta suburb in search of a classic car after posting on the popular want-ad website. Their bodies were recovered Monday in woods in rural Telfair County. An autopsy Tuesday confirmed their identities. Towns turned himself in Monday. His father told CNN affiliate WSB on Tuesday that his son said he was innocent. “He said, ‘Daddy, I ain’t had nothing to do with this,’ ” Ronnie Towns Sr. told the station. “It ain’t Jay. I don’t believe he did it.” The suspect’s father told WSB that he went into the woods Monday where Towns was hiding and talked him into surrendering. His son had no prior record, he said. Telfair County Sheriff Chris Steverson said Towns had the “last known communications” with Bud Runion. The couple made the trip to look at a 1966 Mustang, and once Runion got to Telfair County, the suspect communicated with him, according to the sheriff. He did not say who called whom. McRae is about 180 miles from Marietta, where the Runions lived. “Early on in the investigation, we did contact Mr. Towns, and we did interview him and by the information he provided, we found it to be false and deceptive,” the sheriff said shortly before Towns turned himself in. “After we interviewed him, our efforts to contact him were unsuccessful. Today we’ve contacted his family, and they’ve been helpful in locating him.” At the victims’ home in Marietta, people placed flowers at a memorial around a flagpole in the front yard. A neighbor had lowered the flag to half staff. Another neighbor brought a child’s bicycle. He said Bud Runion used to fix bikes through a church group for children in need. “Bud is a veteran. He and June are great people. They give so much; they are selfless,” Josh Patterson, the couple’s son-in-law, said Monday. Though the overwhelming majority of Craigslist transactions occur without incident, the site has a history of being co-opted by criminals. Just in recent years, there have been numerous such instances. In Henderson, Nevada, police said a man placing an ad in July met three men at a park, who took him to a vacant house, tied him up, beat and robbed him, then escaped in his car. In March, a San Jose, California, woman responding to an ad for a cellular phone was allegedly kidnapped at gunpoint by two men who drove her to an ATM and demanded her passcode, police told a newspaper. In May 2013, a Maine teenager drove to Portland to sell his BMW sedan to a 29-year-old who had responded to his Craigslist ad. The teen was allegedly forced into his own trunk and driven to Delaware, according to media reports and an FBI affidavit. 11 disturbing crimes linked to Craigslist",3263,Steve Almasy,0.077,0.897,0.026,-0.9764

Frein faces a dozen charges, including terrorism and first-degree murder, in connection with a September ambush outside the state police barracks in Blooming Grove, Pennsylvania. He is accused of shooting two state troopers, killing Cpl. Bryon Dickson and injuring Trooper Alex T. Douglass, and then leading a small army of law enforcement officers on a weeks-long manhunt in eastern Pennsylvania. The self-styled survivalist and military buff was captured on October 30 at an abandoned airport. Who is Eric Frein? The manhunt lasted almost seven weeks, and involved as many as 1,000 officers at times. Authorities said the search cost more than $11 million in salaries, travel, equipment, utilities and other expenses. Prosecutors had previously said they intended to seek the death penalty. They submitted the formal paperwork on Tuesday. Frein’s lawyer said the move was expected. “There’s a lot of work ahead, and there’s just so much more to do,” said attorney Michael Weinstein. “We need to make sure we have everything analyzed correctly. Right now, it’s all just in the early stages, so once we get the evidence laid out we can go from there,” he said. Police uncover Frein’s trove of survival supplies After his arrest, Frein allegedly told investigators that he “wanted to make a change (in government) and that voting was insufficient to do so, because there was no one worth voting for,” according to an affidavit filed in Pike County. Frein called the killing of Dickson an “assassination,” the court documents said. The suspect said the shootings were an attempt to bring about a change in government and to “wake up people, because it was all he could do.” His next court appearance is scheduled for Thursday.

15,15,01/28/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/27/us/weather-forecast-dilemma/index.html,Better safe than sorry or #Snowperbole? The epic storm that wasn’t,US,CNN,"It’s the “crippling and potentially historic” blizzard that turned out to be neither. “They were trying to out-drama each other,” architect Rebecca Uss in New York City said Tuesday, speaking of officials in the region who had warned of the coming snowstorm. “In hindsight, it was overkill,” said Brian Beirne, who was sledding with his son Micah on New York’s Upper West Side. “It’s much ado about nothing.” Roberto Gonzalez slept in the lobby of a building, curling up near a radiator, since the restaurant he worked at closed too late Monday for him to get on the subway to go home. “When I woke up, I expected the end of the world. I went outside and nothing (had) happened. What storm?” Some people in the Northeast are concerned the government cried wolf. “They decided to close,” a woman named Anesah, who works with international students in Philadelphia, tweeted about her workplace.  There “isn’t a flurry to be found. I don’t think they’ll ever give us off again. #crywolf.” “This #snowFail does not bode well for civilian cooperation with the terms of the next snow emergency in NYC,” Lisa B. in New York said on Twitter. Government officials say the measures taken, including travel bans, are helpful for the quick cleanup of streets and, most importantly, are signs of erring on the side of caution. “Better safe than sorry,” said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, who had warned Monday that the storm could be one of the largest “in the history of this city.”  Instead, “It’s going to be a fast return to normalcy,” de Blasio said. Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy was asked at a news conference Tuesday about suggestions that the predictions were “overblown.”  “That would be an oversimplification,” he said, laughing. The eastern part of the state was heaviest hit and is still receiving “significant and continued snowfall,” he said. Still, despite previous warnings that people might be without power for days, “By and large we’ll be back to normal for most of our state tomorrow,” Malloy said. Many people had stocked up on days’ worth of necessities and prepared to hunker down for what the National Weather Service said could be a “raging blizzard.” Some are now calling it all “snowperbole.” But Liz Childs, who works at a hospital in New York, said she doesn’t believe authorities overreacted. “I feel we were lucky this time,” she said. “I think we dodged a bullet.” Sights and sounds of the blizzard Some who forecast the weather professionally felt the need to apologize, including Gary Szatkowski, with the National Weather Service in Mount Holly, New Jersey. “My deepest apologies to many key decision makers and so many members of the general public,” he wrote Tuesday on Twitter. “You made a lot of tough decisions expecting us to get it right, and we didn’t.  Once again, I’m sorry.” He wasn’t alone. An online collection showed several similar tweets from meteorologists, including one from News 12 New Jersey’s Dave Curren saying the forecast “deflated as much as New England Patriots footballs.” Many of the responses to these posts were supportive. “You are making a prediction about the future. Closing roads at 11 p.m. when it snows saves lives,” Jennifer Smith in New York wrote to Szatkowski.  “No apology necessary.” Government officials face a tough dilemma. They don’t want to shut everything down, keeping children home from school and people home from work, but they also do not want to risk a disaster. “Look at what happened in Atlanta when the city wasn’t prepared,” Frank Flores said in a Facebook discussion. He was referring to an incident a year ago this week in which people were stranded along miles and miles of icy interstates, paralyzing the metro area for more than 24 hours. Many ultimately abandoned their cars and walked home. There’s some hand-wringing over the forecasting models used.  Here’s the basic idea, from CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller: “Meteorologists largely depend on three major forecast models:  the NAM (North American Mesoscale), the GFS (Global Forecast System), and the ECMWF (European Center for Medium Range Forecasting).  Meteorologists will look at all of these and, using their own expertise, local knowledge, etc., formulate a forecast.  In this case, the NAM and the ECMWF both showed 2 feet of snow or more for New York City, while the GFS (which has just been upgraded this winter) showed a more conservative 6 to 12 inches. “The National Weather Service forecasters in New York certainly went all in with the NAM and ECMWF forecasts, and all but ignored the GFS, without providing much room for uncertainty that should come with the GFS showing a vastly different solution.”  (In 2012, the ECMWF “was the media-darling model for properly forecasting Superstorm Sandy to a ‘t’ while the GFS did not,” Miller says.  “Now it is the opposite.”) Still, “the forecast wasn’t too far off if you look at it as a whole,” Miller says. “The heaviest snow fell across much of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Long Island and Massachusetts.  Winds have gusted up to hurricane strength, which was also in the forecast.” Predicted storm surge flooding also came to fruition, he said. “But of course the headlines are going to come from New York City and New Jersey, where a forecast of more than 2 feet turned out to only be about half that,” Miller said. There were 2 feet of snow elsewhere, and “a miss of only 30 to 40 miles in a forecast that was first given 48 hours in advance is not that bad from a strictly forecasting perspective.” But from a “practical perspective,” it’s a “big miss, and has major ramifications with business disruption, wasted resources and tax dollars, etc.,” Miller said. CNN did note the discrepancy among forecasts Monday, even as government officials were announcing closures. “I just got the brand new models in just a minute ago. And one model says for New York City 2 inches – not 2 feet, 2 inches. The other model I looked at said 27 inches,” CNN meteorologist Chad Myers noted. “I hate it when models don’t agree to that extent.” It’s not an exact science, and it’s important for people to know that, Miller says. “As meteorologists we must convey the uncertainty associated with these forecasts.” Opinion: Weather forecasts are always going to be uncertain",6264,Josh Levs,0.053,0.909,0.038,-0.9596
16,16,01/28/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/27/us/georgia-kendrick-johnson-parents-protest/index.html,Was media booted from trial of Kendrick Johnson’s parents?,US,CNN,"Opening statements begin Tuesday in the trial of Kendrick Johnson’s parents in a case growing increasingly controversial after reports that a Georgia judge had the media removed from his courtroom. Exactly what happened is unclear, as The Valdosta Daily Times reported that its reporter, a citizen journalist and two television reporters were escorted out of the courtroom by a Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office deputy who said she was following State Court Judge Mark Mitchell’s order and offered no further explanation. However, the Johnsons’ attorney, Chevene King, said that only CNN affiliate WCTV-TV had its reporter booted from the courtroom. WCTV had no reporting to that effect on its website, nor did CNN affiliate WTXL-TV. A clerk in Mitchell’s office referred questions to Lowndes County Clerk Beth Copeland Green, who had not returned messages as of late Tuesday afternoon. Mitchell, a judge from Thomas County, is presiding over the case after Lowndes County Superior Court judges recused themselves from all proceedings involving the Johnsons in order to maintain fairness. Johnson’s mother and father, along with five other relatives, are in court on misdemeanor charges related to a 2013 protest. Jury selection wrapped up Monday, and opening statements were scheduled to begin at 9 a.m. Tuesday. One black juror and five whites compose the six-man jury, WCTV reported. The alternate is also black, the station said. The “KJ 7,” as the defendants are known, each face a charge of interference with government property for allegedly blocking the entrance to the Lowndes County Courthouse in Valdosta and blocking access to the security checkpoint inside the building. The demonstration was planned after Johnson’s parents became frustrated with the lack of information they had received from local investigators regarding their son, who was found dead inside a rolled gym mat at his South Georgia high school in January 2013, King said. Footage published on YouTube shows authorities arresting family members who held hands, blocking a door to the courthouse. Another video posted to a Kendrick Johnson tribute page on Facebook shows family members later, inside the courthouse, joining hands in front of the checkpoint. The family and others can be heard chanting, “No justice, no peace,” as officers step in to arrest them. The relatives were arrested and released on bond in the April 25, 2013, incident, King said. “It wasn’t until seven days after that protest that the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Department released the investigative file of the teen’s death,” King said. All seven have pleaded not guilty. Upon her release from jail, the same evening she was arrested, Jacquelyn Johnson told WCTV, “I’m going to be right back out at the courthouse in the morning, ready to do it all over again, until we get justice.” Each of the seven family members could face up to a year in prison, a $1,000 fine, or both. There are no plans to entertain any potential plea deals, King said. In May 2013, the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office announced it was closing its investigation into Johnson’s death after determining Johnson, 17, slipped into the mat while reaching for a shoe and got stuck. An autopsy completed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation concluded Johnson died of accidental positional asphyxia. Months later, a pathologist hired by the Johnsons conducted a second autopsy, found evidence of “unexplained, apparent nonaccidental blunt force trauma” to the 17-year-old’s neck and concluded the death was a homicide. In October 2013, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, Michael Moore, launched a federal investigation, which is ongoing. Johnson’s parents, who have been steadfast in their claim that their son’s death was no accident, filed a wide-ranging $100 million lawsuit this month, alleging former classmates beat their son to death inside the high school gym. The suit names 37 people, mostly members of local law enforcement, plus the city of Valdosta as defendants. “We know who killed him. We just have to prove it,” Jacquelyn Johnson said.",4093,Victor Blackwell,0.107,0.852,0.041,-0.9932
17,17,01/27/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/26/us/georgia-inmate-tuesday-execution/index.html,‘Intellectually disabled’ man set for execution,US,CNN,"Twice-convicted murderer Warren Lee Hill is set to be executed in Georgia on Tuesday night despite pleas from human rights groups and legal representatives who say his intellectual disability should make him ineligible for the death penalty. Hill has an IQ of approximately 70 and the “emotional capacity of a young boy,” said his attorney, Brian Kammer. Federal law stemming from a 2002 Virginia case that went to the U.S. Supreme Court says executing intellectually disabled individuals violates the Eighth Amendment’s ban on cruel and unusual punishment. But the case also allows states to define intellectual disability. In Georgia, that means attorneys for death row inmates have to prove mental impairment “beyond a reasonable doubt.” “This is the strictest standard in any jurisdiction in the nation,” Kammer said. Hill’s execution would come two weeks after the state executed Andrew Brannan, a Vietnam War veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder who killed Laurens County Deputy Kyle Dinkheller in 1998. Kammer also was Brannan’s counsel. Kammer, who has represented Hill for 20 years, said in any other state, Hill would be serving a life sentence. Hill was sentenced to death in 1990 for killing fellow prison inmate Joseph Handspike, beating him to death with a nail-studded board. At the time, Hill had been serving a life sentence for the 1985 shooting death of his girlfriend Myra Wright. “We acknowledge that Mr. Hill should be held accountable for his actions and behavior,” Torin Togut, president of the Arc of Georgia, said in a letter written on Hill’s behalf. “However, it is our contention that Mr. Hill, who has an intellectual disability, should not be subject to capital punishment.” The Arc is a nonprofit organization that advocates for and serves people with intellectual and developmental disabilities. Hill also has the support of the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities, the Georgia NAACP and former President Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn Carter. The victim’s family and former jurors have also expressed support for mercy in Hill’s case, saying they weren’t given the option of life without parole when sentencing him to death. Kammer said seven doctors agree that his client is intellectually disabled, including three doctors for the state who initially evaluated Hill and said he didn’t meet Georgia’s standard. Kammer said those doctors have since signed an affidavit admitting they felt rushed during Hill’s examination and now believe he does meet the standard for “intellectually disabled.” In previous clemency hearings, attorneys for the state have argued that Hill served in the Navy, held a job and managed his money before killing his girlfriend – signs that he didn’t necessarily meet the legal standard for intellectually disabled, even though he has a low IQ. But Kammer said examples of Hill achieving “self-sufficiency” don’t make a strong case for his execution. Several of the letters supporting Hill’s clemency cite last year’s Supreme Court decision that struck down a Florida law that used “unscientific standards for determining intellectual disability” for death row inmates. Attorneys tried to use the Hall v. Florida decision as grounds to spare the life of Georgia inmate Robert Wayne Holsey, who was sentenced to death for the murder of a local sheriff’s deputy. Holsey, who also had an IQ of 70, was executed in December. Hill’s case was presented Monday before the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles. A statement from the board said it “will make a decision prior to the scheduled execution,” which is set for 7 p.m. Tuesday.",3648,Stephanie Gallman,0.156,0.744,0.101,-0.9931
18,18,01/27/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/26/us/winter-storm-timeline/index.html,Here’s what you need to know about the blizzard of 2015,US,CNN,"The first major snowstorm of 2015 has hit the Northeastern United States. The National Weather Service describes the storm as a “crippling and potentially historic blizzard” that could bring up to 3 feet of snow, heavy winds, widespread power outages and epic travel difficulties. Airlines canceled thousands of flights, and government officials across the Northeast urged residents to take heed of the weather warnings and prepare for the storm. States of emergency are in place in seven states across the region – Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and New Hampshire. Here’s what’s going on across the region: New York officials has shut down all public transportation and put a travel ban on roads in 13 counties. “This is a serious situation. If you violate this state order, it’s a possible misdemeanor; it’s fines up to $300,” Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. At the governor’s request, the New York National Guard put 260 soldiers and airmen on duty to assist in the storm’s response. New York City Public Schools will be closed Tuesday. “The good news is the sun will come out again, we just don’t know when,” said Cuomo. ‘Don’t underestimate this storm,’ mayor says Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy has declared a state of emergency and signed an order banning travel. “People need to take this storm seriously,” he told reporters.

The men, dubbed the Friendship Nine after the Rock Hill, South Carolina, college that eight of them attended, were looking to make a statement about the plight of the segregated South. And that’s just what they did. On Wednesday, the attorney who represented the men almost 5½ decades ago is scheduled to return to court to have their names cleared. In a poetic twist, Circuit Court Judge John C. Hayes III, who will preside over the hearing, is the nephew of the judge who originally sentenced these largely unsung civil rights heroes. The prosecutor who pushed for this momentous day, 16th Circuit Solicitor Kevin Brackett of Rock Hill, leans on a quote from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. when asked why he was motivated to take up the cause of the Friendship Nine: “The arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends towards justice.” Lunch counter protests had become the cause celebre the year before, in 1960, just two hours up the road in Greensboro, North Carolina. African-Americans, many of them students, sought to break the barrier of segregated lunch counters by sitting in “white-only” sections. As the protests spread from Greensboro to other parts of the South, protesters were arrested and charged. Civil rights groups had to pay the mounting bails and fines that the protesters were incurring. The men of Friendship College wondered whether paying fines and bail – to the very people who were oppressing them, no less – was the best course of action. Rather than pay the $100 for their release, the men felt they could make a more profound statement by accepting the full punishment for trespassing: 30 days of hard labor. “It showed that this was a moral crusade against injustice,” Rolundus Rice of The Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change in Atlanta said. “Most of the support came from working-class African-Americans, so it was very expensive to bail out a lot of protesters. So, in a sense, what they did is turn the system on its head. So if you are going to incarcerate me, you are going to pay for it,” Rice said. On the evening of January 30, 1961, Clarence Graham, a student at Friendship and civil rights organizer, sat down to write a letter to his parents. “By the time you read this, I suppose you both will be upset and probably angry, but I hope not. I couldn’t tell you, but this morning I wanted to, but just didn’t know how.” He and his cohorts had been planning for months. They were ready on the morning of January 31, 1961, and just after 11 a.m., they arrived at McCrory’s 5-10-25 cent Variety Store in downtown Rock Hill. Local authorities had caught wind of their plans and awaited their arrival. The men stood outside, protesting for a spell before entering. The details of exactly what happened inside were disputed in court, but what is known is that 10 men walked in and – in defiance of the era’s Jim Crow laws – sat at the counter where people of their skin color were forbidden. They were taken to jail, where they sat until their quick trial on trespassing charges. “Try to understand that what I am doing is right,” Graham wrote to his parents before his arrest. “It’s not like going to jail for a crime like stealing, killing, etc., but we’re going for the betterment of all colored people.” They spent the night thinking and praying, hoping that what they did next would shock the conscience of a nation. Ernest Finney, a young African-American civil rights attorney from the area, represented the group. Records of the trial have long since been destroyed, so it’s not clear who said what in the courtroom, but the group was found guilty and offered a choice of paying a $100 fine or being sent to a labor camp for 30 days. Nine of the men chose the labor camp. One chose the fine. “Jailers and the municipalities were receiving these funds to perpetuate the oppression, right?” Rice asked. “It was a practical reason behind the ‘jail, no bail’ (movement).” The men were shipped out to the York County Prison Farm to begin their sentences, but according to local news reports, many of the Friendship Nine were sent to solitary confinement. Pictures from local newspapers document how the prison farm became a rallying point for protesters. It was a shot in the arm for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, Congress of Racial Equality and NAACP, Rice said, because the authorities were saying, “OK, we have to have another strategy to confront this.” The group served 28 days at the camp and was released early – not for good behavior, but because local officials wanted to get them out before the national press arrived. On Wednesday, the national press will shine a spotlight on the men, in a reminder of the country’s checkered history on civil rights. Hayes is expected to right the wrong of his uncle by clearing the men’s names and vacating their sentences. Author Kimberly Johnson, who wrote a children’s book about the men, “No Fear for Freedom,” was integral in getting the Friendship Nine’s case on the court docket. She met the still-living members of the Friendship Nine at a local restaurant in 2011, and after listening to their story, found herself surprised that she had never heard of them. “I was proud to be African-American because I looked at them and thought what a wonderful thing they had done to open the path for me as a children’s author,” she told CNN. “I know I would not be where I am today if folks before me had not forged the way, so I was very honored to be in their presence.” After reading a speech from the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. addressing how demonstrators arrested for nonviolent protests weren’t disobedient in the broad sense of the word, but rather, “just being disobedient to the immorality of what that law represented,” she began thinking about what she could do to help vindicate the Friendship Nine, she said. She shared her thoughts with Brackett and asked whether the men could get a pardon, a request Brackett had field before. But he had his reservations. “A pardon is an act of forgiveness, and what these guys needed wasn’t forgiveness because they didn’t do anything wrong. What these guys needed was justice, and a pardon didn’t really speak to the underlying problems with the fact of the conviction in the first place.” Having their convictions vacated would attack those underlying issues head-on, he felt, and while he’s proud to be able to “play some small part in history” by exonerating the men, don’t call him a hero. “The real act of heroism was done by these men 54 years ago,” he said. The men of the Friendship Nine, based on their activities and accomplishments both during and after their 1961 stand, are an impressive bunch. Here’s a little about them from James Felder, author of “Civil Rights in South Carolina: From Peaceful Protests to Groundbreaking Rulings”: – John Gaines was the NAACP president at Friendship during the 1961 protests. He went on to get his law degree at Howard University in Washington, then joined the NAACP Legal Defense Fund. He is now retired and living in Florence, South Carolina. – Thomas Gaither was a CORE field organizer who traveled to Rock Hill to help organize the protests. He is the only one who did not attend Friendship. In the summer of 1961, he helped organize the Freedom Riders in the South. After a stint in the Army, he became a biology professor. He is now retired and lives in Pennsylvania. – Clarence Henry Graham was CORE’s chief organizer. After school, he joined the Air Force, then went on to become a social worker for South Carolina. He has now retired and lives in Rock Hill. – W.T. “Dub” Massey graduated from Friendship and went on to get his master’s degree from nearby Winthrop University. He spent his career teaching in public schools. He’s now semiretired (he still picks up a class or two as a substitute teacher). – Robert McCullough, the valedictorian of his high school before going to Friendship, was known by many as “brilliant” and was a natural leader for the group.  After college, he joined the Air Force. He earned degrees from Winthrop University in business administration and political science before returning to Friendship to teach. McCullough died in 2006 at age 64. – Willie McCleod was involved in the protest movement before coming to Friendship. After college, he volunteered for the Army and came home to Rock Hill after his service and started a business. He lives in Rock Hill and occasionally speaks to community groups about the events of the 1960s. – James Wells graduated from Friendship and went on to enlist in the Air Force. After his time in the military, he went back to school and earned a law degree from the University of Illinois. He practiced law in Columbia, South Carolina, before retiring in Rock Hill. – David Williamson Jr. moved to the North after school before returning to the Carolinas, where he became a banker and property manager. He has retired from full-time work but still works as a substitute teacher at Rock Hill schools. – Mack Workman moved to New York after school and worked with troubled children as part of the state Office of Children and Family Services. He retired in 2006 and still lives in New York.",9371,Devon M. Sayers,0.088,0.813,0.099,0.9783
20,20,01/27/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/26/us/whale-watching-california/index.html,An upside of climate change? Gray whales abundant in California,US,CNN,"The cheering, clapping fans are greeting them with choruses of oohs and ahhs, hero worship for the rock stars of the sea: whales. Whale-watching boats out of Southern California are reporting almost every excursion returns to harbor with giddy patrons carrying images of large marine mammals in their cameras and minds. “This season has just been magical, there’s just no other way to describe it,” said Dan Salas, a captain for Harbor Breeze Cruises.  “And this is just the beginning of gray whale season. It’s going to go all the way until May.” The gray whales are making their annual migration south from the Arctic Ocean where they feed, down to Mexico, where they breed during winter and late spring. “We know that the ocean is changing, the Earth is warming, the ice melting, and this might be giving the gray whales more (easier) access to food,” said Kera Mathes, marine biologist with the Aquarium of the Pacific. “With more access to food, the gray whales might be able to leave the Arctic waters earlier.” During a recent Salas trip, the captain closely followed two gray whales making a parallel journey south near Long Beach. The whales flipped their flukes out of the water and took dives, while dozens of eyes and cameras followed each move. Salas left that pair of migrating gray whales to search for a second set of gray whales, a rarity, a mother and her brand new calf. “There’s mama and there’s baby,” the captain shouted over the boat’s loudspeaker.  “The baby was born today. Happy birthday.” The mother and baby cetaceans dipped underwater and reappeared, often with a spritz from their blowholes. On this trip, the gray whales did not breech out of the water completely, looking like some sort of slick television commercial. Those picture postcard breeches are uncommon, according to biologists and whale tour boat captains, but any sight of any part of a whale caused celebration. “CNN had that pretty interesting documentary, “Blackfish,” and it brought a lot of attention to our customers, to where they mentioned how excited they were to see the whales in the wild, their natural environment,” said Salas. “Since that documentary our business has increased and we will hear the kids cheering, ‘They are free.’” Orcas, killer whales in captivity, were the subject of “Blackfish.” Free-swimming orcas have been spotted this season in Southern California along with some Humpback whales and the usual preponderance of a variety of dolphins playfully jumping in clusters. Wide-eyed and smiling children chattered with each sighting. “I’ve been seeing Mother Nature and the birth of a new whale,” said 11-year-old Connor Parrish from Missouri.  “And the awesome dolphins, which are my favorite ocean animal, so it’s been good.”",2752,Paul Vercammen,0.02,0.869,0.111,0.9921

It’s Tuesday and here are the 5 things to know for your New Day The weather outside is frightful: Manhattan is a ghost town. The Boston Common is buried in white. The New England coastline is being whipped by near hurricane-force winds and waves. Welcome to the blizzard of 2015. Up to 58 million people could be put into the deep freeze. More than 4,300 flights have been canceled today. And several states are asking motorists to stay off the road. New York’s mayor is calling it “one of the largest snowstorms in the history of the city.” Stay safe, northeasterners! Ain’t nobody spies like us: The men would sometimes say they needed to meet to exchange tickets, but they never seemed to end up actually attending or discussing a sporting event or a concert. The reason for the puzzling behavior, according to a federal complaint, is that the men were Russian spies exchanging intelligence information in New York City.  But the FBI was watching. And yesterday, they arrested one of the men. (The other two got away). Never surrender: After 112 days of fighting, Kurdish fighters have taken the Syrian city of Kobani from ISIS’ grip. A day earlier, Iraq said that its Diyala Province had been “liberated” from ISIS. So, that’s two pieces of good news in a brutal militant campaign. In Kobani, the Kurds were going house to house in the newly liberated area to check for booby traps. Once the traps are removed or defused, the fighters will invite residents to return to their homes. A sad end: The Indonesian military said today it was stopping its efforts to try to find and recover the remains of AirAsia Flight QZ8501 almost a month after the commercial jet crashed into the sea. But there was no indication that Indonesia’s search and rescue agency was ending its mission to recover victims’ bodies. Flight QZ8501 went down on December 28 as it flew from the Indonesian city of Surabaya toward Singapore with 162 people on board. Talks but no trust: A message reported to be from retired Cuban leader Fidel Castro late last nighty endorsed the fledgling talks to restore diplomatic relations between Cuba and the U.S., but added Castro still “didn’t trust” U.S. officials. Last month, Cuba and the United States exchanged prisoners and agreed to discuss normalizing relations that had been trapped in over five decades of Cold War animosity. Despite the major shift in policy, for over a month Castro made no public comment on the deal, until now.",2567,Ed Payne,0.11,0.817,0.073,-0.9748

Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson, along with five family members, each face a charge of interference with government property for allegedly blocking the entrance to the Lowndes County Courthouse in Valdosta, Georgia, and blocking access to the security checkpoint inside the building. The demonstration was planned after Johnson’s parents became frustrated with the lack of information they had received from local investigators regarding their son, who was found dead inside a rolled gym mat at his South Georgia high school in January 2013, King said. Footage published on YouTube shows authorities arresting family members who held hands, blocking a door to the courthouse. Another video posted to a Kendrick Johnson tribute page on Facebook shows family members later, inside the courthouse, joining hands in front of the checkpoint. The family and others can be heard chanting, “No justice, no peace,” as officers step in to arrest them. The relatives were arrested and released on bond in the April 25, 2013, incident, King said. “It wasn’t until seven days after that protest that the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Department released the investigative file of the teen’s death,” King said. All seven have pleaded not guilty. Upon her release from jail, the same evening she was arrested, Jacquelyn Johnson told WCTV, “I’m going to be right back out at the courthouse in the morning, ready to do it all over again, until we get justice.” Each of the seven family members could face up to a year in prison, a $1,000 fine, or both. There are no plans to entertain any potential plea deals, King said. In May 2013, the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office announced it was closing its investigation into Johnson’s death after determining Johnson, 17, slipped into the mat while reaching for a shoe and got stuck. An autopsy completed by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation concluded Johnson died of accidental positional asphyxia. Months later, a pathologist hired by the Johnsons conducted a second autopsy, found evidence of “unexplained, apparent nonaccidental blunt force trauma” to the 17-year-old’s neck and concluded the death was a homicide. In October 2013, the U.S. attorney for the Middle District of Georgia, Michael Moore, launched a federal investigation, which is ongoing. Johnson’s parents, who have been steadfast in their claim that their son’s death was no accident, filed a wide-ranging $100 million lawsuit this month, alleging former classmates beat their son to death inside the high school gym. The suit names 37 people, mostly members of local law enforcement, plus the city of Valdosta as defendants. “We know who killed him.

He was 88. “Joe went unexpectedly and passed away Saturday night,” friend and former producer Steve Garrin said. Franklin was a fixture on late-night radio and TV in New York, working at WJZ and WOR, and recently at the Bloomberg Radio Network. “The last two weeks were the first time he ever missed a broadcast in over 60 years” Garrin said. Though he never broke onto the national scene, Franklin was “in many ways, the pioneer of the modern TV talk show format,” according to his website, which says he interviewed more than 300,000 guests. The likes of Woody Allen, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand, Bill Cosby and Liza Minnelli got early exposure on his show. He also interviewed offbeat characters who would give “The Joe Franklin Show” a “great uniqueness. On any given night you might find a world renown artist sitting next to a balloon folder from New Jersey,” his website says. He was remembered as a “NYC legend” and “radio and TV icon who was the spirit of a hard-working New Yorker” by fans on Twitter. Others said that his “accidental absurdism was like an Ionesco play every night” and that “Joe Franklin was every New Yorker’s oddball, congenial neighbor.” People we’ve lost in 2015 Franklin, who was often parodied on “Saturday Night Live” by Billy Crystal, also played himself in such films as “Manhattan,” “Ghostbusters” and “Broadway Danny Rose.” He was an avid collector of entertainment nostalgia.

Actress Martha Plimpton tweeted: “All the best things about New York are going away. RIP Joe Franklin.” And a tweet from Actor Harvey Fierstein read: “Joe Franklin gone!!!! Damn! He gave me my first TV exposure and I certainly wasn’t alone in that.” That sentiment may be his enduring legacy, as comedy writer Chris Regan tweeted: “Before YouTube, Twitter, etc., the ambitious-but-not-necessarily-talented had few options.

Soon we will see what no one has ever seen before: Crisp, clear pictures of the tiny, icy world. “The pictures are what we’re all waiting for,” Alan Stern, New Horizons principal investigator, told CNN. Up until now, the best images of Pluto have been a few pixels shot by the Hubble Space Telescope. The images, released in 2010, took four years and 20 computers operating continuously and simultaneously to produce, according to Marc Buie of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado. They show what NASA called an “icy and dark molasses-colored, mottled world that is undergoing seasonal changes in its surface color and brightness.” That’s not a very glamorous description, but NASA said the images confirmed Pluto is a “dynamic world that undergoes dramatic atmospheric changes, not simply a ball of ice and rock.” New Horizons is aiming its Long-Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) telescope at Pluto to help navigate the final 135 million miles (220 kilometers) of its 3 billion mile journey. Besides LORRI, the space probe is packed with cameras and other instruments. By mid-May, we should get “better than Hubble” photos. We’ll also see Pluto’s five moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx. Stern expects new “optical navigation images” to arrive any day now. “I think of Pluto as a kind of a Christmas present that’s been sitting under the tree” waiting to be unwrapped, Stern said. “I just can’t wait to see what’s there.” New Horizons was launched on January 19, 2006. It will arrive at Pluto on July 14, 2015. The probe is 27 inches (0.7 meters) tall, 83 inches (2.1 meters) long and 108 inches (2.7 meters) wide. It weighed 1,054 pounds (478 kilograms) at launch. New Horizons was launched before the big debate started over whether it’s a planet. For the scientists on the New Horizons team, Pluto is very much a planet – just a new kind of planet. “New Horizons is on a journey to a new class of planets we’ve never seen, in a place we’ve never been before,” says New Horizons Project Scientist Hal Weaver of APL. “For decades, we thought Pluto was this odd little body on the planetary outskirts; now we know it’s really a gateway to an entire region of new worlds in the Kuiper Belt, and New Horizons is going to provide the first close-up look at them.” Some interesting tidbits about Pluto: – Pluto is classified by NASA as a dwarf planet. – It has five known moons: Charon, Nix, Hydra, Kerberos and Styx. – Pluto is about two-thirds the diameter of Earth’s moon. – It probably has a rocky core surrounded by ice. – It’s one of a group of objects that orbit beyond Neptune in the Kuiper Belt. – Pluto is about 20 times as massive than Ceres, the dwarf planet between Mars and Jupiter that will be explored by the Dawn spacecraft on March 6, 2015. – Pluto has a 248-year-long elliptical orbit around the sun. – From 1979 to 1999, Pluto was actually closer to the sun than Neptune. – Pluto was discovered in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory in Flagstaff, Arizona. – It was named by 11-year-old Venetia Burney of Oxford, England.",3154,Amanda Barnett,0.012,0.961,0.027,0.7908

The former Negro League upstart turned Cubs legend turned favorite son of Chicago died Friday of a heart attack in the Illinois city,  family attorney Mark Bogen said. It was a week shy of his 84th birthday. A public memorial will be scheduled, Bogen said. Cubs Chairman Tom Ricketts described Banks as “one of the greatest players of all time.” “Words cannot express how important Ernie Banks will always be to the Chicago Cubs, the city of Chicago and Major League Baseball,” Ricketts said. “… He was a pioneer in the major leagues. And more importantly, he was the warmest and most sincere person I’ve ever known.” “Approachable, ever optimistic and kindhearted, Ernie Banks is and always will be Mr. Cub.” Farewell to ‘Mr. Cub’ Ernie Banks, an elegant ambassador and all-time great The thing is, Banks wasn’t just a great baseball player, but a great champion for his sport and adopted city. The Windy City’s mayor, Rahm Emanuel, called him “one of Chicago’s greatest ambassadors.” Emanuel said, “He loved this city as much as he loved – and lived for – the game of baseball.” And baseball loved him back – not just for the player he was, but the man he was. This sentiment was evident on social media, with one man writing, “I’ve heard a lot of Ernie Banks stories in my life, a lot. But not one of them showed him in a negative way.” One person tweeted that, like the recently departed Stan Musial, Banks was “never too big for fans.” “Mr. Cub will play 2 today,” wrote another man. “He’s with the Angels now and hopefully he’ll get a ring.” That message alluded to the fact that Banks, despite all his stellar play over his career, never earned a World Series ring. In fact, the last time the Cubs won baseball’s ultimate prize was 1908. But you’d never know it from Banks’ omnipresent smile. He became the Chicago franchise’s first black player in 1953. That happened three years after the Dallas native started his professional career in the Negro Leagues with the Kansas City Monarchs, then spent two years in the Army. After the Monarchs sold his contract to the Cubs, Banks jumped straight to the Major Leagues – hitting .314 in the 10 games he played in that first season. He became Chicago’s starting shortstop the next year, then had his real breakthrough in 1955 when he racked up 117 RBIs. His 44 home runs that season were at the time the most ever for a shortstop. (He hit 47 homers three years later, still a National League record for the position.) Banks kept it up as his career rolled along. Late umpire Tom Gorman once recalled that in 1957, pitchers Don Drysdale, Bob Purkey, Bob Friend and Jack Sanford knocked down Banks with pitches, according to a story on the Cubs’ website. “And each time he was knocked down,” Gorman said, “Banks hit their next pitch out of the park.” The accomplishments piled up through Banks’ retirement after the 1971 season: 2,583 hits, 11 National League All-Star selections, two of the league’s Most Valuable Player awards, and 512 home runs, including five seasons hitting more than 40 homers. And in 1977, six years after his last at-bat, Banks was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. It’s no wonder, then, that he was voted the “Greatest Cub Ever” in a 1969 Chicago Sun-Times fan poll. After all, he was known both as “Mr. Cub” and “Mr. Sunshine.” Hall of Fame manager Leo Durocher, who was known for saying “Nice guys finish last,” made an exception for Banks. “Banks is one nice guy who finished first – but he had the talent to go with it,” Durocher said. And this from sportswriter Arthur Daley: “He rejoices merely in living, and baseball is a marvelous extra that makes his existence so much more pleasurable.” Bogen, the family lawyer, said that Banks “would go right up to people and ask about their families and how they were doing rather than baseball.” “He wanted to know all about people’s lives. Baseball was not the first thing he would talk about,” the attorney said. “He cared about people.” His work on and off the field led to his receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation’s highest civilian honor, in 2013. “To have this award passed on to me is certainly a great joy,” Banks told CNN’s Jake Tapper at the time. “It’s something I’ll never forget.” The slugger left an impression on President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama, too.

The league said the Super Bowl-bound New England Patriots used footballs that didn’t meet league specifications in the first half of the AFC championship game last Sunday. “While the evidence thus far supports the conclusion that footballs that were under-inflated were used by the Patriots in the first half, the footballs were properly inflated for the second half and confirmed at the conclusion of the game to have remained properly inflated,” the NFL’s statement said. The statement said the NFL wants to know “specifically whether any noncompliance was the result of deliberate action. We have not made any judgments on these points and will not do so until we have concluded our investigation and considered all of the relevant evidence.” Forty interviews have been conducted, the NFL said, but it didn’t say whether investigators had talked to star quarterback Tom Brady or coach Bill Belichick. Brady, the central figure in the controversy, said Thursday that nobody from the NFL had talked to him. He and the coach said they don’t know how the balls became under-inflated. Internet reacts to Brady’s press conference Patriots Chairman and CEO Robert Kraft said the NFL spent three days talking to Patriots employees, but he didn’t specify whether Brady or Belichick were interviewed. “During the three days they were here, we provided access to every full- and part-time employee the league’s representatives requested to speak with and produced every communication device that they requested to search,” Kraft said in a statement, his first about the the flap dubbed Deflategate. What the heck is Deflategate? Eleven of the 12 game balls the Patriots provided were under-inflated by about 2 pounds per square inch each, ESPN reported. Regulation pressure is 12.5-13.5 psi. A ball with lower inflation is supposedly easier to grip and may give the passer a competitive advantage. NFL Executive Vice President Jeff Pash and Ted Wells of the law firm Paul, Weiss are leading the investigation, the statement said, and Renaissance Associates, an investigatory firm, has been hired to assist in reviewing electronic and video information. The investigation started “promptly on Sunday night,” the statement said, ” and so far has included 40 interviews with “Patriots personnel, game officials, and third parties with relevant information and expertise.” The inquiry started after Indianapolis Colts linebacker D’Qwell Jackson intercepted a Brady pass in the first half. The Patriots beat the Colts 45-7. According to Newsday, he took the ball to his team’s equipment staff, which then informed head coach Chuck Pagano, who told general manager Ryan Grigson, who told NFL director of football operations Mike Kensil, who told the officials on the field. However, on Thursday at Pro Bowl practice, Jackson said he didn’t say he thought the ball was flat. “I made a great play on a great player, and I wanted to keep it as a souvenir,” Jackson said in an interview with CNN affiliate KNXV. “So I handed it off. “The next thing I know I’m in the middle of Deflategate, so I don’t know how that happened, and I was just doing my job, and I seem to be in the middle of everything. But I’ve got a ton of respect for that organization, New England. They outright beat us hands down and that’s pretty much all I can say about it.” The Patriots will face the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl XLIX on February 1 in Phoenix, Arizona.

Delta spokesman Morgan Durant said, “It was a Portland, Oregon, to Atlanta, Georgia, flight. Delta is supporting the sweeping process carried out by authorities.” The Southwest flight was coming from Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The F-16 fighter jets were from McEntire Joint National Guard Base in South Carolina and returned to the base after the passenger planes landed. “What you see is a very hefty response,” said CNN Aviation Correspondent Rene Marsh.

29,29,01/24/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/23/us/annapolis-fire/index.html,Victims of Annapolis fire remembered,US,CNN,"Before a deadly fire that burned a home in Annapolis, Maryland, technology executive Don Pyle and his wife, Sandra, spent a day with their four grandchildren. The day included shopping for costumes, dinner at the Medieval Times restaurant and a sleepover at Pyle’s waterfront mansion. Monday was a school holiday, and the children – Alexis (Lexi) Boone, 8; Kaitlyn (Katie) Boone, 7; Charlotte Boone, 8; and Wesley (Wes) Boone, 6 – stayed over, a family spokeswoman said. Pyle, his wife and the four grandchildren are now feared dead after a suspicious fire destroyed the mansion early Monday morning. Authorities have recovered four bodies from the ruins. They continue to search for the others. The smiling grandchildren and their grandparents are seen in images released by family members, who described a boundless and unconditional bond between the victims. • Lexi loved her sister and new baby brother, her classmates, field hockey, lacrosse and ice skating, the family said in a statement Friday. “She was thoughtful, social, smart, and determined,” according to the family. “She loved her dog Sophie. Her favorite adventures included trips with her parents, grandparents, and cousins. Lexi wanted to be a vet or on television when she grew up. She was going to be famous.” • Katie loved her family and her new brother, the statement said. She was described as a kind and compassionate girl who enjoyed soccer, gymnastics, ice skating and singing to Taylor Swift. Her recent adventures included her birthday party with the Baltimore Ravens cheerleaders and a trip to New York City. “Having just turned 7, she was loving and thoughtful beyond her years,” the statement said. • Charlotte loved her family, horses, basketball and swimming. Her friend held a special place in her heart, the statement said. “She was fun-loving, intelligent, and kind,” the statement said. “She wanted to be known as a gamer with an epic love of Minecraft. Charlotte loved making videos with her guinea pig, Oreo. Charlotte’s future dreams were to run an animal rescue.” • Wes loved his friends and family, Doctor Who, Legos, Minecraft, Plants vs Zombies and swimming, according to the family. “Wes was sweet and loving and looked up to his older sister immensely. He loved all his friends and he especially looked forward to seeing his classmates at school every day. He loved trips to the beach with his family. In his future, Wes wanted to build robots.” • Pyle loved his family, especially the grandchildren, according to the family. They affectionately called him “Pop-Pop.” He treated friends as family and enjoyed long-term friendships from high school. His also liked fishing, golf, skiing and entertaining. “Don loved the Ravens, Orioles, and Delaware Blue Hens Lacrosse. Don also cherished traveling with his wife.” • To his wife, Sandy, each grandchild occupied a special place in her heart, according to the family. They called her “Dee-Dee.” For her, too, friends were like family. She was passionate about the Ravens, Orioles, the beach and travel. “She was a one-of-a-kind original – fun-loving, caring, and generous. She loved every animal, especially her rescue dogs, and contributed to numerous animal welfare groups. Sandy was incredibly sensitive to the needs of others and generous beyond words.” On Thursday, two bodies were retrieved from the ruins of the mansion, authorities said. Two other bodies were recovered the day before. The remains were taken to a medical examiner’s officer for autopsies and identification, Anne Arundel County Fire Department Capt. Russ Davies said in a statement. “There are still two occupants unaccounted for,” he said. “This remains a complex scene and much work remains to be done.” Two bodies were found Wednesday in the ruins of the Annapolis mansion, which burned three days ago, fire officials said. “On behalf of the Boone and Pyle families, we wish to express our gratitude and appreciation for the love and support being shared with us during this tragic event,” the family’s statement said. “We are blessed that so many family, friends and neighbors have come together for us in our time of need.” The statement confirmed the identities of the six people firefighters and others have been searching for in the ruins of the waterfront home. “Our love for our family is boundless,” the statement said. “Our loss demands time and quiet reflection to process these feelings. We ask that you respect our need for privacy. Life is fragile. Make time today to embrace your loved ones.” For the first time since the fire broke out, local and federal officials were able to secure the structure and access the foundation of the 16,000-square-foot house on Wednesday. Cadaver dogs led them to the bodies, officials said. Officials would not discuss where the bodies were or the possible cause of death. Authorities are treating the house as a crime scene. Officials said it is standard procedure for a case such as this and no evidence has been found to indicate suspicious activity. The house belonged to Pyle, chief operating officer for ScienceLogic, company spokesman Antonio Piraino said. The sheer size of the structure and the fact that three-fourths of the building had collapsed into the basement, with deep piles of  debris still smoldering, compounded the search, Anne Arundel County Fire Capt. Robert Howarth said Tuesday. He is leading the investigation along with a team from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. “You’re looking at five standard houses put together,” he said Tuesday. “This is more of a commercial fire than it is a residential fire. There are a lot of businesses that aren’t 16,000 square feet. That adds to it.” Pyle had not been heard from on Monday, and his colleagues at ScienceLogic were “hoping for a miracle,” CNN affiliate WJLA-TV in Washington reported. Heavy equipment was brought in to aid in the search for victims and clues, a process that could take days. “We have some very unique challenges with this house,” Howarth said. “The construction of the house contained a lot of very heavy materials. We’re looking at some steel beams that weigh in the area of 7 tons.” When the first firefighters arrived on the scene early Monday, they received conflicting reports about whether the family may have been out of town. But after interviews with relatives, it was determined that six members of the family were missing, fire officials said. Fire officials said they were alerted to the fire about 3:30 a.m. Monday. About 80 firefighters responded. The ATF national response team responded because the fire was deemed suspicious, Howarth said. The fire department said crews had difficulty putting out the fire because the house is secluded, apparently with no fire hydrants on the scene. Photos the fire department posted on Twitter showed hoses stretched for long distances. Davies said it took hours for fire department tanker trucks and a fire boat on an adjacent creek to bring the fire under control. Pyle’s company biography described him as an industry veteran who has held multiple CEO positions, with more than 25 years’ experience in information technology infrastructure software and hardware management. Pyle told The Washington Post last year that after holding positions in a family business, he decided to look for an “industry that was in its infancy and something that would have growth potential.” He started in a sales position in a firm that connected computers over transmission lines, and later sold both hardware and software components for the Internet. Pyle told the newspaper he eventually moved from sales to sales management to general management positions. In 1992, the company went public and was sold to Cisco Systems five years later for $4.2 billion, according to the Post.",7815,Ray Sanchez,0.065,0.83,0.105,0.9901

The aircraft went down around 4:30 p.m. (7:30 p.m. ET) Friday at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms, California. “Our hearts go out to the families and friends of the two Marines we lost in this tragic accident,” Maj. Gen. Michael Rocco said Friday. The names of the Marines will be released after the next of kin are notified. According to its website, the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center’s mission “is to conduct relevant live-fire combined arms training, urban operations, and Joint/Coalition level integration training” for Marines and Navy sailors. It’s located in San Bernardino County some 130 miles east of Los Angeles and abuts Joshua Tree National Park. While missions in combat zones are obviously more dangerous, there are many examples of fatal U.S. military aircraft crashes during training missions as well. Last March, for instance, a F/A-18C Hornet’s pilot died after a crash about 70 miles east of Naval Air Station Fallon in western Nevada. The Navy described the combat jet as a “total loss.” The Marines have had their share of deaths during training missions as well. In 2012, seven Marines died in a midair collision of two U.S. military helicopters along the Arizona-California border. Six of those killed during what was called a routine training operation were based at California’s Camp Pendleton, while the other was out of Yuma, Arizona, the Marine Corps said. The previous year, the Marines had at least three deadly incidents involving helicopter crashes in noncombat areas – one off of Hawaii, another in the northern part of Camp Pendleton and the third on that same Southern California base. The latter two crashes both involved members of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing, like the one of Friday.",1888,Greg Botelho,0.121,0.832,0.047,-0.9776

Joseph Sledge, who was wrongfully convicted in 1978, said he feels wonderful about his freedom.  He is now 70-years old. Sledge was exonerated by a three-judge panel who reviewed post-conviction DNA evidence from the victims. The panel said that evidence excluded Sledge as a suspect.  A witness who testified that Sledge had admitted to the murders recanted his testimony in 2013. Josephine Davis and her daughter Aileen Davis were discovered in September 1976 inside their home in Elizabethtown, North Carolina.  The women had been beaten and stabbed multiple times; Aileen Davis had been sexually assaulted. Man freed by DNA evidence after 20 years dies a year later The day before the women’s bodies were found, Sledge had escaped from White Lake Prison Camp, approximately 4 miles from the victims’ home. He had been serving a four-year sentence for larceny. Sledge was picked up after he was spotted in Dillon, South Carolina, driving a stolen car, arrested and brought back to North Carolina, where he was charged with two counts of first-degree murder in the deaths of the Davises. At trial, the state presented forensic evidence linking Sledge to the crime.  Two inmates also testified against Sledge, saying he had admitted to the crimes behind bars. He was convicted and sentence to life in prison. DNA frees North Carolina’s longest-serving death row resident During the more than three decades Sledge was in prison, he maintained his innocence, filing numerous post-conviction motions on various grounds. All were denied without hearing. In 2003, however, his request for new DNA testing was granted; testing began five years later. The North Carolina Innocence Inquiry Commission took on investigating Sledge’s case. It in December found “sufficient evidence of factual innocence to merit judicial review.” Speaking to reporters outside the Columbus County jail, Sledge said, “When you’re conscious of something you didn’t do, you can live with yourself.  It’s between you and your maker.” The family of Josephine and Aileen Davis expressed their disapproval with the panel’s decision. Catherine Brown, Josephine Davis’ granddaughter, reading from a prepared statement, said, “We, the family, are heartbroken by this decision.” Sledge, who was wrongly incarcerated for 37 years, addressed the Davis family directly, saying, “I’m very, very sorry for your loss.  I hope you get closure in this matter.” The commission, which began operating in 2007, is the first of its kind in the country, and is separate from the appeals process, according to the organization’s website.

Edgewater Police Chief  William Skidmore said the fire was accidentally started by building workers, CNN affiliate WABC reported. “Our hearts go out to everyone who was affected by this; it was a long and challenging night,” Edgewater Mayor Michael McPartland said during a Thursday morning press conference. “The fire is contained and under control.” An additional 520 residents from nearby buildings were temporarily affected, McPartland said. Two residents and two firefighters suffered minor injuries, but no one was reported missing, the mayor said. Some pets, however, could not be rescued, he said. Edgewater Fire Chief Tom Jacobson said the blaze broke out around 4:30 p.m. Wednesday at the Avalon at Edgewater, along the Hudson River across from Manhattan. More than 200 firefighters battled to bring the fire under control as the flames shot high into the sky. “We arrived on scene and we encountered the sprinkler system going off and smoke conditions on the first floor,” Jacobson said. “I sent in crews to check what was going on; we had heavy fire on the ceiling.” Most residents were not home when the fire began, but some found themselves trapped in the blaze. “The fire conditions were getting worse. It was in the floors and it just traveled,” Jacobson said. “We had crews on three floors. We had the task of dealing with multiple rescues on different floors because the smoke had traveled through the building, and we had to evacuate the people. We had people stuck on back balconies.

33,33,01/23/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/22/us/nfl-patriots-deflategate/index.html,Tom Brady weighs in on ‘Deflategate:’ ‘I didn’t alter the ball’,US,CNN,"New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and head coach Bill Belichick on Thursday said they didn’t deflate footballs at Sunday’s AFC Championship Game, a controversy that’s cast a shadow over their team as it prepares for the Super Bowl. “I didn’t alter the ball in any way,” Brady said at a press conference. “I have no knowledge of wrongdoing.” “I have no explanation,” Belichick said of the controversy dubbed “Deflategate.” The NFL is investigating why game balls the Patriots provided for Sunday’s AFC Championship Game were underinflated. ESPN, citing NFL sources familiar with the probe, reported that 11 of 12 game balls that the Patriots used on offense were found to be underinflated by about 2 pounds per square inch each. A ball with lower inflation is said by some to be easier to grip and may give the passer a competitive advantage. What the heck is “Deflategate” anyway? Brady said he picked the footballs he wanted to use five hours before the game, feeling the laces and the leather but not paying attention to the inflation level. The NFL mandates balls should be 12.5-13.5 psi. “It’s not like I squeeze the football,” he said. “I grip the football.” Brady said he didn’t touch the balls again until the game began. The referees inspect footballs about two hours before kickoff and deliver them to “ball attendants” who take them to the sidelines, according to NFL rules. The Patriots’ opponent, the Indianapolis Colts, provided their own footballs. Brady also said he couldn’t tell any difference between the balls in the first and second halves. Internet reacts to Brady’s press conference Radio station WEEI in Boston reported that the underinflated balls were discovered in the first half and replaced with properly inflated balls in the second half, when the Patriots expanded their lead over the Indianapolis Colts. The final score was 45-7. Ball inflation may not be a problem at the February 1 Super Bowl game between the Patriots and the Seattle Seahawks. Michael Signora, the NFL’s vice president of football communications, said Chicago Bears equipment manager Tony Medlin will oversee the game balls. Dressed casually in a sweater and a wool hat, Brady seemed amused by the controversy at times during the 30-minute press conference. Brady, 37, is the handsome face of the Patriots, one of the United States’ most successful sports franchises. The team has won three Super Bowls, all with Belichick and Brady, and won its division, the AFC East, 12 times in 14 years. His stardom reaches far beyond football fans, since he’s married to model Gisele Bundchen and has worked as a model himself. His net worth is $120 million, according to Celebritynetworth.com. Though Brady himself has a clean image, suspicions of the Patriots remain because of a 2007 cheating incident – called “Spygate” – in which the team stole defensive signals from the New York Jets. Belichick was fined $500,000 and the NFL took away a first-round draft pick. Some people are suspicious of Brady. Speaking Thursday morning on CNN affiliate KTCK Sports Radio, former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman said, “Its obvious Tom Brady had something to do with this. For the balls to have been deflated, that doesn’t happen until the quarterback wants that to happen, I can assure you of that.” Hall of Fame coach John Madden told The Sports Xchange he believed Belichick was clueless about the ball pressure, but “I can see – and you hate to make examples of what you can see because that sounds like you are accusing someone – but I can see that being between the quarterback and the equipment guy.” Though the NFL announced its investigation on Monday, Brady said nobody from the league has questioned him. Brady said he didn’t know anything about Deflategate until a Monday interview with WEEI, in which he said the idea of tampering with footballs is “ridiculous.” On Thursday, he said, “I was surprised as anybody when I heard Monday morning what was happening.” When a reporter directly asked Brady whether he was a cheater, the quarterback replied: “I don’t believe so. I’ve always played within the rules.” He added that he doesn’t have all the answers, but doesn’t know of anybody in the Patriots organization who might have done something wrong with the ball. “I don’t know what happened over the course of the process with the footballs. I was preparing for my own job, doing what I needed to do,” he said. Earlier on Thursday,  Belichick said he was “shocked” to hear allegations that his team’s footballs were underinflated. He said that he’s learned more about the football inflation process in three days than he has known or talked about in his 40 years in the league. “In my entire coaching career, I have never talked to any player (or) staff member about football air pressure,” the Patriots coach said at a press conference. “That is not a subject that I have ever brought up. To me, the footballs are approved by the league … pregame, and we play with what’s out there.” Belichick – one of the most successful head coaches in NFL history with three Super Bowl rings and 211 regular-season wins – insisted he had no explanation for how the footballs his team used Sunday might have gotten deflated. But “in the future,” Belichick said, New England’s game balls will be inflated at high-enough levels – so closer to 13.5 psi than 12.5 psi, when they may naturally drop to below acceptable levels – “to account for any possible change during the game.” His comments come days after Indianapolis reporter Bob Kravitz broke the news after Sunday’s game that the NFL was looking into whether the Patriots used underinflated footballs during the AFC championship contest. The underinflation came to light on the field after Indianapolis Colts linebacker D’Qwell Jackson intercepted a pass thrown by Brady. For all the talk by unnamed sources, the NFL’s official statement on the controversy is succinct: “We are continuing our review and will provide information as soon as possible.” Deflategate is not the NFL’s only scandal this year. The league established a six-game unpaid ban for personnel who violate the league’s policy on domestic violence after several players were arrested.

34,34,01/23/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2014/09/10/us/terror-threats-after-9-11/index.html,"A frightening, far-reaching new world of terror threats since 9/11",US,CNN,"Even as smoke rose from the World Trade Center, as people clawed through rubble at the Pentagon, there was one name – and one name only – synonymous with terror in the United States. Al Qaeda. Times have changed, and the terror landscape has changed with it. Public Enemy No. 1, Osama bin Laden, is gone, killed by U.S. commandos in a 2011 Pakistan raid. The group he notoriously commanded no longer dominates. Sure, Ayman al-Zawahiri makes an occasional pronouncement, but other groups have garnered more than their share of chilling headlines for acts such as the failed underwear bomb plot on a Detroit-bound jetliner, the Westgate Mall siege in Kenya and the attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. In short, al Qaeda has a lot more competition these days – including from groups it inspired, it partners with and that splintered from it. Fifty-nine groups on the U.S. State Department’s list of “Foreign Terrorist Organizations.” Some of them stand out for what they’ve said and done in the 13 years since the September 11, 2001, attacks, as well as for how Washington and its allies in the West have reacted to those actions. Here’s a look at some of those organizations: ISIS What is it? How does a group show its hatred for its enemies, America included? How does it prove its willingness to do anything – even the most heinous acts imaginable – for its cause? How does it invoke terror, in the basest sense? It acts like ISIS. When it landed on the State Department list in 2004, the Abu Musab al-Zarqawi-led group was known as al Qaeda in Iraq and was known for attacking U.S. and allied forces, assassinating officials and beheading hostages. It suffered blows before being reborn as the Islamic State in Iraq, and later the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, names that signified its new mission: to create a far-reaching caliphate. From 2006: Al-Zarqawi killed in U.S. bombing raid This shift was accompanied by a fresh focus on things such as providing food, health care and other necessities. Yet its tactics in handling nonbelievers and its foes did not change much. The first terror group to build an Islamic state? What has it done? ISIS has taken advantage of instability in Syria, where it’s become one of the most feared groups trying to oust President Bashar al-Assad, and Iraq, where it has made inroads in opposition to Iraq’s unsettled, Shiite-led government, to take over vast swaths of territory. This success has something to do with its appeal to dissatisfied Sunni Muslims. At the same time, a lot of its success stems from its using a brazen, often brutal and heavy-handed approach to force its will. This is an organization, after all, that’s been so ruthless even al Qaeda disowned it. That savagery was on display in the recent beheadings of American captives James Foley and Steven Sotloff, journalists who had gone to the Middle East to chronicle war and ended up victims of it – their gruesome deaths taped and posted online. What’s been done about ISIS? In its first incarnation, the group that would become ISIS was a prime target for U.S. forces in Iraq. But after U.S. forces pulled out of Iraq, a power vacuum opened in Syria with the uprising against al-Assad. And when Iraq’s military appeared overmatched, the group flexed its muscles yet again. In Iraq, at least, ISIS earlier this summer got pushback from its old foe. U.S. President Barack Obama sent U.S. warplanes back in to punish ISIS fighters. To hear U.S. and Iraqi officials say it, these airstrikes have effectively halted and pushed back the ISIS onslaught. But that’s only in Iraq. Obama is among many who have acknowledged the group still has a “safe haven” in Syria. So what’s next? On Wednesday night, Obama promised a stepped-up, U.S.-led military campaign to defeat ISIS in Syria as well as Iraq – opening the door to more U.S. airstrikes, as well as authorizing more American troops to support the Iraqi military in its fight. “Our objective is clear: We will degrade, and ultimately destroy, ISIL through a comprehensive and sustained counterterrorism strategy,” Obama said. Obama: ‘No safe haven’ for ISIS in Syria or anywhere else AL-SHABAAB What is it? Al-Shabaab, which translates as “The Youth” in Arabic, emerged in the 2000s as the upstart faction of a bin Laden-funded group called al-Ittihad al-Islami that sought to create an Islamist emirate in Somalia. In 2006, this new group and its ally, the Islamic Courts Union, took over Mogadishu and stirred fears it would move into neighboring countries. That threat spurred Ethiopia to enter Somalia that year, ousting the ICU from power. Other international troops would follow, including from Kenya and the African Union. All this put Al-Shabaab on its heels, but it never went away. In fact, it appeared to become more radicalized and international in scope. No longer was Al-Shabaab focused just on Somalia; rather, it has increasingly lashed out at other governments as well as civilians outside its native country. What has it done? Southern and central Somalia have been Al-Shabaab’s hotbed for years, with the group exercising control there by “recruiting, sometimes forcibly, regional subclans and their militias, using guerrilla warfare and terrorist tactics,” the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center reports. Yet, more and more, Al-Shabaab has looked beyond the East African country for friends and targets. In 2012, the group’s then-leader, Ahmed Godane, pledged allegiance to al Qaeda and announced his followers “will march with (al Qaeda) as loyal soldiers.” By then, Al-Shabaab already had killed over 70 people in twin suicide bombings in Kampala, Uganda, during the 2010 World Cup final. Afterward, Godane warned: “What happened in Kampala was just the beginning.” Ruthless leader aimed to extend reach, eyed West Al-Shabaab has been true to his promise. That includes killing activists, aid workers, journalists and attacking places frequented by foreigners. The most high-profile attack occurred last fall, when its militants casually walked into the upscale Westgate Mall in Nairobi, Kenya, then began gunning down shoppers – allegedly torturing some hostages before killing them. The four-day long siege ended with as many as 67 dead and parts of the mall destroyed. What’s been done about it? The United States hasn’t been directly attacked by Al-Shabaab, but it has made it a priority. In 2011, then U.S. Africa Command head Gen. Carter Ham said “the greatest risks risks right now in East Africa are Al-Shabaab and the violent extremists that they represent.” Even if it hasn’t deployed ground troops, Washington has used its military might against al-Shabaab. The latest instance came this month, when U.S. drones and commandos used “Hellfire missiles and laser-guided missiles” to kill Godane, a man who rose to power after a 2008 U.S. airstrike killed his predecessor. The United States hasn’t been doing it alone. Its allies include not only the Somali government but those in Ethiopia and Kenya, plus the African Union. According to the U.S. government, together these allies have made significant inroads in beating back the group. Successor named to slain leader AL QAEDA IN THE ARABIAN PENINSULA (AQAP) What is it? Osama bin Laden was the son of a Yemeni man and grew up in Saudi Arabia. So it is noteworthy the organization he led has found some of its greatest strength, and successes, in the Arabian Peninsula. Like its namesake, Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP as it is widely known, consists of Sunni Muslim extremists who want to unseat local authorities and who are willing and able to strike out at the West, in the West. The group has taken advantage of political instability in Yemen to gain a foothold there as a home base and place to carry out its plans since its creation in 2009,  when Yemeni and Saudi extremists decided to join forces under the leadership of emir Nasir al-Wahishi. But it’s also made a big splash internationally – whether through its high-profile plots; its glossy, Western-style magazine and propaganda tool, Inspire; or the fact one of its most well-known members, Anwar al-Awlaki, was American. What has it done? While Yemen has been affiliated with al Qaeda for years (the deadly 2000 attack on the USS Cole), it became a focal point in 2009 because of two incidents: The first, in November, was the shooting rampage at Fort Hood, Texas, by U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Hasan, who had exchanged emails with al-Awlaki. Then, on Christmas Day, Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab – who later acknowledged having traveled to Yemen and being “greatly inspired” by al-Awlaki “to avenge the killing of innocent Muslims” – tried unsuccessfully to detonate explosives in his underwear on an Amsterdam-to-Detroit flight. Underwear bomber sentenced to life AQAP subsequently became a prime target for Yemeni and U.S. forces, forcing it to devote time and resources to defending itself rather than carrying out fresh attacks in the West. Yet it never went away. Three or four members of AQAP participated in the 2012 attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four people – among them Ambassador Chris Stevens –  according to several sources who have spoken to CNN. And concerns rose earlier this year that AQAP could launch a terror attack inside Yemen, Europe or the United States. Sources: Al Qaeda operatives played part in Benghazi attack Stream of al Qaeda threats has U.S. intelligence concerned What’s been done about it? The United States hasn’t stood idly by amid these attacks and threats, nor has the Yemeni government. In addition to Afghanistan and Pakistan, American drones have frequently flown over and struck AQAP targets in Yemen, as with the 2011 killing of al-Awlaki. There’s been an intensive military campaign on the ground as well. Yemeni troops have fought on the ground, assisted at times by U.S. commandos and others, though no Americans have taken part in combat. According to the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center, these offensives led al Qaeda fighters to withdraw “from their southern Yemen strongholds” in 2012. Still, the threat wasn’t eliminated entirely, nor was its intent to target the West. BOKO HARAM What is it? Boko Haram’s stance on the West is as clear as its name, which translates from the Hausa language as “Western education is forbidden.” This isn’t an education reform group, though, but one with a terrifying history of killings, bombings and mass abductions. A bloody insurgency, a growing challenge Twelve years ago, a charismatic cleric named Mohammed Yusuf formed Boko Haram to further his push for a pure Islamic state in Nigeria. Police killed him in 2009, and some say the resulting crackdown on his group did more to embolden Yusuf’s followers than weaken them. In 2010 statements soon after new leader Abubakar Shekau took over, he aligned his group with al Qaeda and threatened the West. True to his word, his group has killed at least 25 people in a suicide attack on a United Nations building, as well as killed and kidnapped Westerners elsewhere. What makes Boko Haram different from some other groups, however, is that its anti-Western actions have been confined to Nigeria. What has it done? Kill. Burn. Kidnap. And, where it can, govern under its strict interpretation of Sharia law. Boko Haram fighters have spent years battling Nigerian troops, mostly in the country’s north and east. The group has also killed civilians – including in Jos, Kano and the capital Abuja – in bombings on crowded markets and attacks on otherwise peaceful villages. The act for which Boko Haram is probably best known internationally is its abduction of over 230 schoolgirls earlier this year from the town of Chibook in northeastern Nigeria. A man claiming to be Shekau vowed later in a video that he’d sell the girls “in the market.” ‘I will sell them,’ Boko Haram leader says But to define what Boko Haram has done by this single act understates the amount of terror it’s inflicted over the years, particularly in northeastern Nigeria. Its targets have been Christians, government officials and troops and Muslims who don’t subscribe to its beliefs or way of doing things. Its approach has been to show no mercy, as its members rampage through villages, kidnap women and children, and assassinate politicians and religious leaders. Boko Haram: The essence of terror What’s been done about it? As the most destabilizing element in Africa’s most populous nation – a country of 175 million people, not to mention vast oil reserves – Boko Haram cannot be easily ignored. The audacity of its tactics has stirred many worldwide, from Australia to Zambia, against it, as exemplified in the “Bring Back Our Girls” campaign. This widespread disdain notwithstanding, Boko Haram has not been subject to a large-scale, large-impact international military campaign. Yes, the United States has put a $7 million bounty on Shekau’s head, given  technical and financial support to Nigerian teams battling the insurgency and even flown unarmed surveillance aircraft over Nigeria looking for the missing schoolgirls. But it hasn’t offered more direct support for a few reasons. For one, there’s a sense that Boko Haram may not pose a direct threat to U.S. security. And second, U.S. law restricts the country’s ability to work with Nigeria’s military that has been accused of war crimes and other abuses, a senior State Department official has said. U.S. support to Nigeria beset by complications AL QAEDA What is it? Its name translates from Arabic to “The Base.” In many ways, that’s exactly what al Qaeda has been: the platform from which others have spun, associated with or been compared with as they strive to inject and project their brand of Sunni extremism. Al Qaeda’s first home was Afghanistan, where Arabs had gone to fight Soviet forces and the local government, and its founder, bin Laden, was from Saudi Arabia. Yet its goal extends beyond any one place or region. The movement seeks to create a far-reaching Islamic caliphate and defeat those in its way. The United States became al Qaeda’s chief enemy after the Soviet Union’s withdrawal from Afghanistan in 1989, one year after the group’s inception. This enmity was ignited in part by U.S. troops’ arrival in Saudi Arabia and their subsequent invasion of Iraq. In between a series of terror attacks, al Qaeda articulated its aims. In 1996, bin Laden declared a holy war against U.S. forces. Two years later, he and his deputy Ayman al- Zawahiri endorsed a fatwa that stated Muslims should kill Americans, including civilians, anywhere in the world. “The 9/11 attacks were a shock, but they should not have come as a surprise,” the 9/11 Commission report said. “Islamist extremists had given plenty of warning that they meant to kill Americans indiscriminately and in large numbers.” What has it done? One of the first high-profile attacks attributed to al Qaeda may have been its most prescient: the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center. Six people died in that attack, a fraction of the nearly 3,000 killed eight years later in the 9/11 attacks when a pair of commercial airliners were flown into the Twin Towers in New York, another hit the Pentagon near D.C. and another crashed in Pennsylvania. Still, the 1993 attack was significant because it showed al Qaeda was willing and able to strike inside the United States. Other attacks followed. The targets included U.S. troops, such as the USS Cole bombing and bombings at military bases in Saudi Arabia. More than 220 people died in twin 1998 truck bombings outside U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. And after 52 commuters died in two July 2005 attacks on London’s transit system, al-Zawahiri threatened that “more (destruction) will come, God willing.” “Our message is clear – what you saw in New York and Washington (in 2001) and what you are seeing in Afghanistan and Iraq, all these are nothing compared to what you will see next,” al-Zawahiri said then. From 2005: Al Qaeda threatens more UK, U.S. attacks Since then, al Qaeda hasn’t pulled off a direct attack on the West on the scale of 9/11 or the London bombings. But it hasn’t been quiet either, even after the 2011 death of bin Laden. That includes various pronouncements – such as the forming of an al Qaeda affiliate for India – or partnering with or supporting other groups as they launch attacks of their own. What’s been done about it? There were efforts to disrupt al Qaeda before 2001, yet none significantly hampered its momentum or its leadership. As the 9/11 Commission notes, the “CIA broke up some al Qaeda cells (but) the core of bin Laden’s organization nevertheless remained intact.” September 11 changed everything. Weeks later, NATO invoked Article 5 for the first time – meaning everyone in the alliance was obliged to support the United States. Soon, the United States and its allies had tens of thousands of troops in Afghanistan going after al Qaeda fighters and the Taliban government sheltering them. U.S. troops are still there 13 years later, though Obama has said combat operations will end this year. The U.S.-led coalition tried to foil al Qaeda in other ways as well, including cutting off its funding and gathering as much intelligence as it could. By many measures, they have been successful as al Qaeda hasn’t been as active or as destructive as it was in the late 1990s and early 2000s. But time and again, the world is reminded that it’s not just about al Qaeda any more. Other groups have emerged from its shadow and followed its lead. Some are as ruthless, if not more so. Some are as dangerous, if not more so. Some are as zealous in their beliefs, if not more so. All are reminders that the terror threat has not gone away.",17754,Greg Botelho,0.165,0.755,0.08,-0.9999
35,35,01/23/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/22/us/annapolis-fire/index.html,Two more bodies retrieved from burned Annapolis mansion,US,CNN,"Two more bodies were retrieved Thursday from the ruins of a burned Maryland mansion, where six people are thought to have died. Relatives of the family released the names of the four youngest victims, authorities said. The bodies were transported to the medical examiner’s officer for autopsies and identification, Anne Arundel County Fire Department Capt. Russ Davies said in the statement. “There are still two occupants unaccounted for,” he said. “This remains a complex scene and much work remains to be done.” Two bodies were found Wednesday in the ruins of the Annapolis mansion, which burned three days ago, fire officials said. Technology executive Don Pyle, his wife, Sandra, and four grandchildren are feared dead in the fire. Officials said the two bodies have not been identified. Relatives identified the grandchildren as Alexis (Lexi) Boone, 8; Kaitlyn (Katie) Boone, 7; Charlotte Boone, 8; and Wesley (Wes) Boone, 6. They are the children of Sandra Pyle’s sons, Randy and Clint Boone, according to the statement. The children were visiting their grandparents for a sleepover because Monday was a school holiday, a family spokeswoman said. “On behalf of the Boone and Pyle families, we wish to express our gratitude and appreciation for the love and support being shared with us during this tragic event,” the family’s statement said. “We are blessed that so many family, friends and neighbors have come together for us in our time of need.” The statement confirmed the identities of the six people firefighters and others have been searching for in the ruins of the waterfront home. “Our love for our family is boundless,” the statement said. “Our loss demands time and quiet reflection to process these feelings. We ask that you respect our need for privacy. Life is fragile. Make time today to embrace your loved ones.” For the first time since the fire broke out, local and federal officials were able to secure the structure and access the foundation of the 16,000-square-foot house on Wednesday. Cadaver dogs led them to the bodies, officials said. Officials would not discuss where the bodies were or the possible cause of death. Authorities are treating the house as a crime scene. Officials said it is standard procedure for a case such as this and no evidence has been found to indicate suspicious activity. The house belonged to Pyle, chief operating officer for ScienceLogic, company spokesman Antonio Piraino said. The sheer size of the structure and the fact that three-fourths of the building had collapsed into the basement, with deep piles of  debris still smoldering, compounded the search, Anne Arundel County Fire Capt. Robert Howarth said Tuesday. He is leading the investigation along with a team from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. “You’re looking at five standard houses put together,” he said Tuesday. “This is more of a commercial fire than it is a residential fire. There are a lot of businesses that aren’t 16,000 square feet. That adds to it.” Pyle had not been heard from on Monday, and his colleagues at ScienceLogic were “hoping for a miracle,” CNN affiliate WJLA-TV in Washington reported. Heavy equipment was brought in to aid in the search for victims and clues, a process that could take days. “We have some very unique challenges with this house,” Howarth said. “The construction of the house contained a lot of very heavy materials. We’re looking at some steel beams that weigh in the area of 7 tons.” When the first firefighters arrived on the scene early Monday, they received conflicting reports about whether the family may have been out of town. But after interviews with relatives, it was determined that six members of the family were missing, fire officials said. Fire officials said they were alerted to the fire about 3:30 a.m. Monday. About 80 firefighters responded. The ATF national response team responded because the fire was deemed suspicious, Howarth said. The fire department said crews had difficulty putting out the fire because the house is secluded, apparently with no fire hydrants on the scene. Photos the fire department posted on Twitter showed hoses stretched for long distances. Davies said it took hours for fire department tanker trucks and a fire boat on an adjacent creek to bring the fire under control. Pyle’s company biography described him as an industry veteran who has held multiple CEO positions, with more than 25 years’ experience in information technology infrastructure software and hardware management. Pyle told The Washington Post last year that after holding positions in a family business, he decided to look for an “industry that was in its infancy and something that would have growth potential.” He started in a sales position in a firm that connected computers over transmission lines, and later sold both hardware and software components for the Internet. Pyle told the newspaper he eventually moved from sales to sales management to general management positions. In 1992, the company went public and was sold to Cisco Systems five years later for $4.2 billion, according to the Post.",5123,Ray Sanchez,0.094,0.864,0.042,-0.9909
36,36,01/22/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2012/07/26/us/mass-murder-survivors/index.html,Making peace with a monster,US,CNN,"Brent Doonan saw the bright muzzle flash of the Colt .45-caliber revolver and crashed facedown to the floor. He watched as his blood spread in a widening pool on his office carpet. “My God this is real,” he thought as the vacant-eyed shooter wheeled away from him and started firing at others in the office complex. “The son of a b****h just shot me.” Doonan was the co-owner of an Atlanta day trading firm in 1999 when one of his customers strolled into his office displaying a strange grin. The man, Mark Barton, then pulled out two pistols from his waistband before methodically shooting Doonan and others while bellowing, “I hope this doesn’t ruin your trading day.” Barton would later commit suicide, but not before he shot and killed nine people and injured 13 more to become one of the nation’s most notorious mass murderers. “I thought he was my friend,” Doonan says. “One second he’s smiling, and the next second his face goes blank and you’re on the floor after being shot.” Surviving with the guilt of living Doonan is a member of a grim fraternity of people who narrowly missed death at the hands of a mass killer. Their ranks grew last week when James Holmes was accused of killing 12 people and wounding 58 others in a movie theater. Though media attention has focused on the resilience of the survivors in the immediate wake of the Aurora, Colorado, shooting, Doonan represents a part of their story that’s seldom told: What happens to them years after the television cameras and reporters have left? That question drove Ron Franscell to track down survivors of some of the most notorious mass killings in American history. He wanted to know why some survivors find a way to move on, while others never recover. What he discovered was disturbing. Most of the 30 survivors he tracked down for his book, “Delivered From Evil,” had lost the will and ability to live, he says. “They’re already dead,” Franscell says. “They’re just waiting for the body to stop. They have no tools to be what they were before.” Most of the people Franscell interviewed missed death “by a hair’s breadth.”  At least two of them talked with CNN about the Colorado shootings. Among Franscell’s survivors: an idealistic college student shot by the infamous University of Texas Tower sniper in 1966 who decided to enter the ministry; a survivor of the 1984 McDonald’s massacre near San Diego who developed a fetish for firearms and serial killers; and a survivor of a 1949 rampage who buried his memories in an old suitcase no one wanted to open. Opinion: Aurora shooting like reliving the Virginia Tech ordeal ‘I don’t care to know his name’ Some people may say the Colorado shooting victims need to learn how to forgive the gunman to move on. Franscell doesn’t buy that. The survivors who fared the best, he found, didn’t grant pardons. “They don’t absolve their would-be killers and they haven’t stopped crying, even decades later,” he says. A little anger and competitive zeal can actually help, says Doonan, whose gripping account of survival is chronicled in Franscell’s book. Doonan was shot five times. He eventually lost his body’s entire supply of blood. A surgeon who got to Doonan as he lay bleeding in an office told him that if he closed his eyes he would die. But Doonan says he was determined not to let Barton win. He was a star wrestler in high school, a competitor who was also supremely fit. Anger fueled his survival instinct. It still does. “At the end of the day, he’s dead, I’m alive and I’m moving on,” he says of Barton. Stories of survival amidst shooting Doonan forged a new life for himself. He left Atlanta after recovering, got married, had a son and is now vice president of Doonan Peterbilt, a heavy trucking company in Wichita, Kansas. But old memories returned when he heard about the Colorado shootings. When he pores through the news accounts, he grows angry when he realizes the name of the alleged gunman is better known than those of the victims. “I don’t care enough to know his name,” Doonan told CNN. “He’s a piece of s**t to me. These guys do it, and their names are out there forever. Victims are left to sink or swim.” Franscell says Americans’ reactions to mass killings are now ritualized: heroic stories about survivors, calls for gun control, psychologists offering insights into the mind of the twisted killer on television. “We talk about ‘remember the survivors,’ but really can you name another person who was dead or wounded from the Tucson shooting other than Gabby Giffords?” asks Franscell, referring to the 2011 shooting of the former Arizona congresswoman that claimed the lives of six people, including a young girl, and wounded 12 others. Doonan says one of the first notes he received after being wounded offered him the best recovery advice. “I got one right out of the gate that said cling to your faith, family and friends and you will never lose your way,” Doonan says. “That was my rock.” Doonan did other things as well. He sought out counseling, wrote about his experiences in a book, “Murder at the Office,” and even reached out to the mother of the man who tried to murder him. (He says she never responded to his request to talk.) Still, memories of the shooting welled up at unexpected moments. Once, Barton came into his bedroom one night. It was nightmare. “He was standing at the foot of my bed laughing, as if to say, ‘I got you,’ ” Doonan says. Where was God in Aurora massacre? Shrinking the monster down to size Sometimes those nightmares infiltrate survivors’ waking hours, Franscell says. Some never feel safe anywhere. Every public space looks like a potential graveyard. Survivors get paranoid about strangers; they sit near exits or with their backs to the walls. They second-guess routine decisions for fear that they’ll run into the monster who almost took their life – even though they know he’s dead or locked away – or perhaps another killer. “Every choice they make, that face comes back to them and they say, do I turn left here or if I go left is that going to put me back into that? ” he says. “That monster is part of every decision they make.” Some can’t forget or forgive their monster so they find another solution – they shrink their monster down to size. “They make a certain peace with the memory of their monster,” Franscell says. “They chose to limit that monster’s role in their lives.” Some start to recover when they think more about those people who didn’t make it. The question is inevitable: Why me, and not them? Often they answer: I owe a debt to the dead to live more fully because I have a second chance at life and they didn’t, Franscell says. One of those who took that attitude was the Rev. Roland Ehlke, who was shot during one of the most notorious mass killings in American history. A movie was made about the shooting, and it’s even referred to in a scene from the Vietnam film “Full Metal Jacket.” It’s the University of Texas Tower sniper shooting. Opinion: Aurora survivors, stay strong Ehlke was strolling on the campus of the University of Texas in Austin in 1966 during a muggy, summer day when Charles Whitman shot him from the observation deck of a tower on the campus. Whitman, a former altar boy and Eagle Scout, was also a former U.S. Marine who, according to his father, could “plug a squirrel in the eye” by the time he was 16. He killed 16 people and wounded 31 that day. (He shot some people from as far as 500 yards.) Two police officers and a civilian eventually snuck up the tower, and shot him to death. Ehlke was wounded three times and lost a friend. He gained, though, a new perspective. He joined the Peace Corps and then went to seminary.  He collected four master’s degrees and a doctorate. Today, he’s a Lutheran minister. “It sounds strange to say that it was a very enriching experience to come close so death,” he says. “I realize how fragile life is and how it can be taken away so easily.” Ehlke says he can’t figure out why he survived and other people didn’t. “For me, it’s a mystery,” he says. “We can’t always answer why this one and not yet another. That’s part of living by faith, knowing that we don’t have all the answers.” Another survivor of the Whitman rampage wasn’t so philosophical. According to Franscell, Houston McCoy, one of the Austin police officer who killed Whitman, suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder for years. “If I get to heaven and see Charles Whitman,” he once said, “I’m going to have to kill him all over again.” Ehlke says the 1966 shootings marked a dark detour in American history. Random shootings, distrust of strangers, declining church membership – all those became the norm. “As a kid in the summer we’d hop on our bikes, ride four miles to the lake and go swimming all day and be told to just be home for supper,” he says. “You wouldn’t think of doing that today.” Warning signs of violence: What to do The suitcase no one wanted to open Other survivors don’t recover as well as Ehlke. Like soldiers returning from war, they suffer from PTSD – except for one telling difference. “Soldiers are at least minimally prepared for this; these folks are not,” Franscell says. Some burrow inside of themselves. They can’t connect emotionally with others, can’t keep jobs or maintain a marriage. Some abuse drugs Franscell discovered. One survivor started mimicking the mass killer who almost killed him. In 1984, James Huberty pushed a mother and child out of the way as he entered a McDonald’s near San Diego, dressed in camouflage pants and combat boots. After yelling, “Everybody down,” he shot and killed 21 people, many of them children. The images of the bodies of children, sprawled next to their bicycles outside the restaurant, are still burned in the memories of people who saw the news reports that day. One of the survivors Franscell profiled was 12 at the time. The boy physically survived, but psychologically he disintegrated. He developed a drinking habit and became emotionally withdrawn. He flinched at loud noises and unexpected touches, once slugging a teacher who grabbed his arms. He became obsessed with guns as well as books and movies about serial killers. He even started dressing in the camouflage pants and tight, dark shirts that Huberty wore on that fateful day, Franscell says. At a loss: Comforting grieving parents And he could never step into a McDonald’s again. He eventually recovered and changed his name. But his turmoil lasted for years, as it will for many of the victims of the Colorado shootings, Franscell says. “There are things that they don’t shake, and they never will,” he says. “I guarantee you that they’re all having nightmares.” The story of Charlie Cohen is one of the most heartbreaking that Franscell uncovered. Cohen was only 12 when Howard Unruh, a World War II veteran, went on a rampage and murdered Cohen’s parents, Maurice and Rose, in Camden, New Jersey. Cohen’s mother ordered him into the closet as Unruh’s heavy footsteps thundered up their home’s stairs. Cohen huddled in the closet as he heard Unruh shoot his mother to death. Unruh would eventually kill 13 people, including three children, that day in 1949. Cohen grew up to become a linen salesman who was known for his sense of humor. Yet he never talked about his parents. When any of his three daughters asked about them, he said they died in an accident. Yet his daughters sensed that Cohen was hiding something. He wouldn’t let them purchase pets or cut flowers for the same reason – they died. And once, when he granted a rare interview to a reporter about his parents’ deaths, he said: “I was a kid. I listened to my mother. She yelled, ‘Hide, Charles, hide!’ That’s what I did. I hid in the closet. “Thing is, I’m still in there.” Unruh was arrested and imprisoned in a state insane asylum. Cohen dreamed of a day when he would get a call telling him that Unruh was dead. He told Franscell that he would go to Unruh’s grave and piss on it, and bury an old, brown suitcase filled with press clippings of his parent’s death. “The suitcase that he put all of the mementoes in was, in effect, everything that was inside of him,” Franscell says. Cohen never got his chance. He died of a heart attack at 72 in September 2009. Unruh outlived him by six weeks. He died at 88 in a nursing home, still lucid up to the last moments of his life, Franscell says. When Cohen’s family found the suitcase, Franscell says they called him to ask if he wanted it. “Nobody had ever opened it, although it was known that it had existed,” he says. Cohen’s memories remained locked away in his suitcase. He never got a chance to bury it, nor mark Unruh’s grave. Someone else did that – though not in the way Cohen intended. When Unruh was buried in an unmarked grave, a cemetery worker planted an object in the fresh dirt. It was an American flag to honor Unruh’s service in World War II.",12874,John Blake,0.163,0.756,0.08,-0.9998

That’s all it took for the exchange to turn deadly. The Police Department in Bridgeton, New Jersey, released video this week showing the death of Jerame Reid, 36, who was shot on the night of December 30. He was a passenger in a car that got pulled over for allegedly failing to stop at a stop sign. The dashcam video shows what happened next. Officer Braheme Days approaches the passenger side door. He asks how the two men inside the car are doing and identifies himself. The conversation is friendly. Days asks to see a driver’s license. Suddenly, he steps back from the vehicle and pulls his weapon. Days shouts over and over: “Show me your hands! … Don’t you f****** move!” He yells at his partner, Roger Worley: “Get ‘em out the car, Rog. We got a gun in this glove compartment.” Days reaches into the car and removes what appears to be a silver handgun. The shouting continues. “I’ll telling you, I’m going to shoot you! You’re going to be f****** dead!” screams the officer. “You reach for something you’re going to be f****** dead.” And later: “He’s reaching! He’s reaching!” Despite the officer’s entreaties, Reid appears to push his way out of the passenger side door. He gets out of the car with his hands in front of him. Both Days and Worley open fire. Reid drops to the ground. The vehicle’s other occupant did not appear to be injured. He got out of the car, lay on the ground and was handcuffed. A December statement from the local prosecutor’s office did not identify the driver. It said a handgun was revealed and recovered during the stop. Both officers have been placed on administrative leave, and an investigation into the use of deadly force is ongoing, the statement said. Bridgeton Police Capt. Michael Gaimari described Days and Worley as “very good officers” responsible for “a lot of key arrests.” Another statement released this week said: “The Cumberland County Prosecutor’s Office is committed to conducting a thorough, fair and impartial investigation into the police-involved shooting death of Jerame Reid. Requests for the release of additional information while the confidential investigation is ongoing stand in the way of completing a neutral, objective and independent evaluation of the facts. This observation is not unique to this matter.” Gaimari said Days was one of four officers who arrested Reid last August on charges that included resisting arrest, drug possession, intent to distribute and failure to appear. The disposition of the case was not immediately known. In addition, Reid had been arrested six times by Bridgeton police since 2009 on charges of making terroristic threats, harassment, burglary, obstruction, marijuana possession and stalking, according to police records. The disposition of each case is unknown. Police and court records list Reid’s first name as Jerome, but the prosecutor’s office listed it as Jerame. In New Jersey, some local leaders are demanding that the state take over the investigation. “Jerome put his hand ups,” said Walter Hudson, chairman and founder of the National Awareness Alliance. “You can see Jerome’s hands are clearly up.” The Police Department reportedly released the video after a public records request was made by the South Jersey Times.

The sheer size of the structure and the fact that three-fourths of the building had collapsed into the basement, with deep piles of  debris still smoldering, compounded the search, Anne Arundel County Fire Capt. Robert Howarth said Tuesday. He is leading the investigation along with a team from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. “You’re looking at five standard houses put together,” he said Tuesday. “This is more of a commercial fire than it is a residential fire. There are a lot of businesses that aren’t 16,000 square feet. That adds to it.” Pyle had not been heard from on Monday, and his colleagues at ScienceLogic were “hoping for a miracle,” CNN affiliate WJLA-TV in Washington reported. Heavy equipment was brought in to aid in the search for victims and clues, a process that could take days. “We have some very unique challenges with this house,” Howarth said. “The construction of the house contained a lot of very heavy materials. We’re looking at some steel beams that weigh in the area of 7 tons.” When the first firefighters arrived on the scene early Monday, they received conflicting reports about whether the family may have been out of town. But after interviews with relatives, it was determined that six members of the family were missing, fire officials said. “We still do not have 100% proof that they’re in this house,” Howarth said. Fire officials said they were alerted to the fire about 3:30 a.m. Monday. About 80 firefighters responded. The ATF national response team responded because the fire was deemed suspicious, Howarth said. The fire department said crews had difficulty putting out the fire because the house is secluded, apparently with no fire hydrants on the scene. Photos the fire department posted on Twitter showed hoses stretched for long distances. Davies said it took hours for fire department tanker trucks and a fire boat on an adjacent creek to bring the fire under control. Pyle’s company biography described him as an industry veteran who has held multiple CEO positions, with more than 25 years’ experience in information technology infrastructure software and hardware management. Pyle told The Washington Post last year that after holding positions in a family business, he decided to look for an “industry that was in its infancy and something that would have growth potential.” He started in a sales position in a firm that connected computers over transmission lines, and later sold both hardware and software components for the Internet. Pyle told the newspaper he eventually moved from sales to sales management to general management positions. In 1992, the company went public and was sold to Cisco Systems five years later for $4.2 billion, according to the Post.",3775,Ray Sanchez,0.108,0.874,0.018,-0.9939

Monday “is not realistic” as a start date, and the court expects to announce a new date next week, said Ginny Hurley, spokeswoman for the U.S. District Court in Boston. Jury selection began more than two weeks ago. Authorities accuse Tsarnaev and his older brother, Tamerlan, of planting two pressure-cooker explosives, hidden in backpacks, near the finish line of the Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013. Three people were killed and more than 260 others wounded in the explosions. Three days later, after the FBI released surveillance photos of the suspects, the Tsarnaevs shot and killed Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer Sean Collier, authorities say. Early the next day, Tamerlan Tsarnaev died of wounds he suffered during a shootout with police, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was found and arrested that night, hiding in a boat behind a house. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev was charged with 30 federal counts, including using a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death.

The FBI has completed its investigation into the August shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, and sent the findings to the Justice Department, a law enforcement official and a separate U.S. official said Wednesday. Justice Department prosecutors will not recommend civil rights charges against Wilson, who killed Brown, because there is not sufficient evidence to support charges, a U.S. official told CNN. The New York Times first reported the development Wednesday. A grand jury decided not to indict Wilson on state charges in November. If Holder decides, based on prosecutors’ recommendation, not to press federal civil rights charges against Wilson, that could rile things up yet again. Antonio French, a St. Louis city alderman who has been involved in the Ferguson protests, thinks some people will be disappointed, at the least. What are the Brown family’s options? Ultimately, the decision will be made by Attorney General Eric Holder, who has said he will announce a decision before he leaves office, which is expected to be by spring. Another Justice Department civil rights investigation into the Ferguson Police Department’s overall track record with minorities is ongoing. Benjamin Crump, an attorney for Brown’s family, declined to comment on the news Wednesday. “The family of Michael Brown Jr. will wait for official word from the Justice Department regarding whether or not any charges will be filed against the police officer who shot and killed him,” Crump said in a written statement. “The family won’t address speculation from anonymous sources.” Legal experts have long noted that a federal civil rights case against Wilson would be more difficult to prove. “The bar is extraordinarily high,” said Joey Jackson, a criminal defense attorney and legal analyst for CNN’s sister network HLN. “You have to show an intentional deprivation of a civil right.” Given how difficult it is to prove intent, and also how many conflicting accounts emerged from the grand jury investigation, “it would be very difficult to move forward federally with a civil rights charge,” Jackson said. If no federal charges are brought against Wilson, who resigned from his position as a Ferguson Police officer in November, some people in the area will be disappointed, said Antonio French, a St. Louis city alderman who lives near Ferguson. “I think you have a lot of people who will be disappointed if this does turn out to be the case. The community and the family wanted a day in court, an opportunity to see all the evidence laid out, cross-examined,” French said. “And it looks like that’s not going to happen. I hope we don’t have any violence as a result of this.” Violent protests erupted in Ferguson after the grand jury’s decision not to indict Wilson in November.  Police are still searching for suspects accused of looting. Protests aren’t likely to stop any time soon, French said. “People have a right to protest. We will probably continue to see that. That’s a good thing. But we want to keep them peaceful, nonviolent,” he said. “Because violence makes the situation worse. It divides the community in a time we need to come together and make everyone feel like they can get equal protection.” Ultimately, he said, some of the protesters’ goals can be achieved outside the courts. “The next steps I think are legislative change,” French said, “trying to make sure that in cases like this we get a special prosecutor by law, and to create a new level of civilian oversight over police departments.” In his State of the State speech on Wednesday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said addressing “the broader, systemic issues” raised by the unrest that followed the killing of Brown would demand “sustained effort.” “The legacy of Ferguson will be determined by what we do next … to foster healing and hope … and the changes we make to strengthen all of our communities,” he said.",4088,Sara Sidner,0.095,0.821,0.083,-0.6229

This would be the second time the former police officer has avoided standing trial in the black teen’s fatal shooting last summer in Ferguson, Missouri. The FBI joined local officials in interviewing more than 200 people – and looked at much the same evidence – as a St. Louis County grand jury that decided in November not to indict Wilson, who is white, on any charges in Brown’s death. That federal law enforcement agency has now completed its investigation into the August shooting and sent its findings to the Justice Department, a law enforcement official and a separate U.S. official said Wednesday. Based on that probe, Justice Department prosecutors won’t recommend civil rights charges against Wilson because there is not sufficient evidence to support them, a U.S. official told CNN. The New York Times first reported the development Wednesday. The Justice Department report has not been completed, and Attorney General Eric Holder ultimately will make the final decision whether to press federal civil rights charges against Wilson. Still, it wouldn’t be a surprise if Holder doesn’t call for charges. While he’s been outspoken on Ferguson, met with Brown’s family and said he understood African-Americans’ mistrust for police after the incident, the attorney general acknowledged in November that “federal civil rights law imposes a high legal bar in these types of cases.” The shooting of the 18-year-old Brown stirred months of emotionally charged, widespread and at times violent demonstrations in Ferguson, a few miles northwest of St. Louis. “Hands up, don’t shoot” became a mantra for protesters nationwide decrying what they called undue, unfair police violence against African-Americans, resonating even after grand jury testimony disputed whether Brown ever actually raised his arms in surrender. Those protests bubbled up in the days immediately after the shooting, with anger growing due to what some saw as law enforcement’s heavy-handed response. And they swelled again after the grand jury’s decision this fall not to indict Wilson on state charges. If Holder decides, based on prosecutors’ recommendation, not to press federal civil rights charges against Wilson, that could rile things up yet again. Antonio French, a St. Louis city alderman who has been involved in the Ferguson protests, thinks some people will be disappointed, at the least. “The community and the family wanted a day in court, an opportunity to see all the evidence laid out, cross-examined,” French said. “And it looks like that’s not going to happen. I hope we don’t have any violence as a result of this.” For now, though, Brown’s family is laying low. What are the Brown family’s options? Benjamin Crump, a lawyer for the family, has said he felt federal civil rights charges against Wilson were “not very likely” given the “very high standard” that has to be met. CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin has noted that authorities would need proof that Wilson exhibited “racial hostility,” presumably by what he said before, during or after the shooting. The Brown camp deferred comment on Wednesday’s news reports suggesting there would be no charges. “The family of Michael Brown Jr. will wait for official word from the Justice Department regarding whether or not any charges will be filed against the police officer who shot and killed him,” Crump said in a written statement. “The family won’t address speculation from anonymous sources.” Even without charges, this story isn’t over. It’s possible that Brown’s family will file a civil lawsuit against Wilson, who resigned in late November citing security concerns. And the U.S. Justice Department still has another open investigation – this one looking at the Ferguson Police Department as a whole. “Anecdotal accounts underscore the history of mistrust of law enforcement in Ferguson that has received a good deal of attention,” Holder said in September. “Our investigation will assess the police department’s use of force, including deadly force. It will analyze stops, searches and arrests. And it will examine the treatment of individuals detained at Ferguson’s city jail.” That investigation could lead to significant changes in Ferguson, much as similar federal probes have produced in New Orleans, Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Cincinnati and elsewhere. But it wouldn’t mean charges for Wilson, personally, or that anyone would go on trial. It’s also possible there could be legislation, policy changes or personnel turnovers not forced by the federal government. In his State of the State speech on Wednesday, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon said addressing “the broader, systemic issues” raised by the unrest that followed the killing of Brown would demand “sustained effort.” “The legacy of Ferguson will be determined by what we do next … to foster healing and hope … and the changes we make to strengthen all of our communities,” he said. At the least, French said, he expects more protests to keep up pressure on authorities. “That’s a good thing,” he said. “But we want to keep them peaceful, nonviolent because violence makes the situation worse. It divides the community in a time we need to come together and make everyone feel like they can get equal protection.” Ultimately, he said, some of the protesters’ goals can be achieved outside the courts. “The next steps I think are legislative change,” French said, “trying to make sure that in cases like this we get a special prosecutor by law, and to create a new level of civilian oversight over police departments.”",5715,Sara Sidner,0.079,0.842,0.079,0.3821

You wouldn’t know it from the Twitter traffic during the State of the Union. The folks at the microblogging site said more than 2.6 million tweets were sent around the world with the hashtag #SOTU. It was a case of ‘come for the speech, stay for the spectacle.’ Sure, the President made a fiesty pitch for economic populism and issued a historic call for transgender protection. But SOTU was a feast for the eyes as well. Here are our 11 favorite social media moments from Tuesday night. First Lady Michelle Obama pulled a major fashion no-no by rockin’ the same dress as Julianna Margulies’ character, Alicia Florrick, on “The Good Wife.”  Good thing they didn’t show up at the same party. Before the speech, the White House tweeted a picture of a tan suit, with the caption, “President Obama’s suiting up for the big speech.” The last time the President wore a tan suit was to take questions in the White House press briefing room in August and Twitter freaked out. Alas, he wore a blue suit to the actual address Tuesday. When Obama made a quick reference to the polarizing Keystone XL pipeline, U.S. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-California) looked as giddy as a game show contestant. Some members of Congress raised their pencils to honor the victims of the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris. During the GOP response, Sen. Joni Ernst shared an anecdote of how she used to tie bread bags over her only good pair of shoes on rainy days. Tweeters don’t loaf around and #breadbags trended instantly. Fortunately, things seems to have worked out for the freshman senator. That was the look on Scott Kelly’s face when the President told the astronaut, who’ll be spending a year on the International Space Station, to “make sure to Instagram.”  Kelly doesn’t have an account (we checked). In the clueless crook department, a driver led police on a chase from the D.C. suburbs to the security checkpoint outside the U.S. Capitol.  Probably not a good place to go, if you’re trying to escape. You can say one thing for the President, he thinks on his feet.  “I have no more campaigns to run,” Obama said, drawing loud applause from Republicans in the chamber.  But Obama had a quick comeback: “I know, ‘cause I won both of ‘em,” drawing even louder applause from Democrats. Not to be outdone, the Republicans gave as good as they got in the snark department. For some tweeters, the best part of #SOTU was, as usual, the live feed of John Boehner’s face. As in past years, the House Speaker kept it tan and grumpy. But the person who won the Internet Tuesday night, delighting audiences with his Founding Father-inspired hairstyle, was Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz. “No one except my wife has cut my hair in decades,” he once told the Boston Globe. “And she’s not a professional.”  Nope, never would have guessed that.",2852,Ed Payne,0.049,0.824,0.127,0.9937

Those who believe China can somehow grow its way out of this problem are fooling themselves. ‘Mathematically, that’s impossible when something is twice as big as something else and growing twice as fast,’ as Chu noted.” — “Logic dictates that if Russia wants to increase the pressure on Europe, it should try beyond the territory of the former Soviet Union,” writes Ivan Krastev in the Financial Times. “It is such a scenario that makes the Balkans a likely hotspot. Russia certainly does not fantasize about bringing Bosnia or Albania into its sphere of influence, and nobody in the Balkans dreams of joining the Eurasian Union. Their major trading partner is the EU — and it is there that businesses look for investment, and would-be émigrés look for new homes.” “As well as being the EU’s backyard, the Balkans are the underbelly of Brussels’ diplomacy. Their banking systems are fragile. If businesses with large deposits and Russian connections were suddenly to pull their money out, the result could be widespread insolvency, and with it civil strife. Pro-western governments would teeter. This is the place to apply pressure, if Moscow wants to make Europeans feel uncomfortable.” — “Our faces are organs of emotional communication; by some estimates, we transmit more data with our expressions than with what we say, and a few pioneers dedicated to decoding this information have made tremendous progress,” writes Raffi Khatchadourian in the New Yorker. “Perhaps the most successful is an Egyptian scientist living near Boston, Rana el Kaliouby.

The lawsuit was filed in federal court in Philadelphia by Vito LoGrasso, who is best known for wrestling under the moniker Big Vito, and Evan Singleton, who wrestled under the name Adam Mercer. “It is not simply that WWE has failed to protect its wrestlers,” court documents say. “WWE deliberately creates and heightens the violence of its matches in order to ‘heat’ up audiences and increase its profits.” WWE is known for over-the-top events, outrageous story lines and matches putting wrestlers against each other and involving high-flying stunts. A lawyer for WWE called the lawsuit without merit, like a “virtually identical one filed by the same lawyers in Oregon.” “WWE has never concealed any medical information related to concussions, or otherwise, from our talent,” said Jerry McDevitt from the K&L Gates law firm. “We will vigorously contest this lawsuit.” The suit, which is dated January 16, is seeking damages to be determined at trial and medical monitoring. It centers on LoGrasso, who wrestled with the WWE from 1991 to 1998 and from 2005 to 2007, and Singleton, who wrestled from 2012 to 2013. As a result of his wrestling injuries, the suit alleges, LoGrasso suffers from serious neurological damage, which includes severe headaches, memory loss, depression, anxiety and deafness. The court documents say Singleton suffers serious symptoms including tremors, convulsions, migraines, memory loss and impaired ability to reason. The lawsuit has the potential to reach class-action status, the suit says. It estimates that at least 500 wrestlers have worked for the WWE, and it says the operation earns $500 million a year. “For most of its history, WWE has engaged in a campaign of misinformation and deception to prevent its wrestlers from understanding the true nature and consequences of the injuries they have sustained,” the lawsuit says. “WWE’s representations, actions and inactions have caused its wrestlers to suffer long-term debilitating injuries, lost profits, premature retirement, medical expenses, and other loses,” the suit states. WWE forces wrestlers to do stunts “in a matter that dramatically increases – often to a near-certainty – their chances of sustaining brain damage,” the suit says. “When performed by, and on, hulking, poorly trained, steroid-using wrestlers with various levels of dexterousness, they are a recipe for disaster– and widespread, long term brain damage.” Yet McDevitt, WWE’s attorney, said the company has been proactive when it comes to handling concussions, even more so than organizations like the NFL. “WWE was well ahead of sports organizations,” the lawyer said, “in implementing concussion management procedures and policies as a precautionary measure as the science and research on this issue emerged.”",2961,Ed Payne,0.131,0.791,0.079,-0.978

They’re covered in a viscous substance that no one can identify. More than 300 have been rescued, but at least 200 are dead, according to the California Fish and Wildlife Department. So what’s happened? “It’s a full-on mystery,” department spokesman Andrew Hughan said. “We have no idea what they are coated in and I’m not sure when we will have the answer.” Authorities are doing two lab tests to determine what the birds, which were found near the San Leandro Marina on Tuesday, are covered in: one testing the water and another examining the birds to check if they died of hypothermia or were poisoned.

The prognosis for birds in care is good, and those that have been cleaned and rescued can be returned to the wild, according to Barbara Callahan, a spokeswoman for International Bird Rescue. “The birds tend to come into care needing hydration and medical stabilization, and we have a mandatory 24-hour stabilization process before cleaning,” she said.

The New York-based agents have come together in recent weeks following a December grand jury decision to not indict the police officer, the sources told CNN. The goal is a “fresh look” into the July death of Eric Garner at the hands of police Officer Daniel Pantaleo, in a case that led to anti-police demonstrations throughout the nation, a senior law enforcement official said. The veteran investigators include an agent from the white-collar crime division who specializes in long-term criminal investigations, a supervisor in the public corruption unit and an agent who investigated the infamous 1997 police torture case involving Haitian immigrant Abner Louima, the source said The investigation, which began in earnest after a grand jury declined to indict the officer, will look at everything from the actions of the responding officers and paramedics on the Staten Island street where Garner died to the role NYPD training may have played in the death, according to the source. The New York City Police Department prohibits chokeholds. “We want … to take a fresh look,” the senior official said. Pantaleo’s attorney, Stuart London, said the agents will find “there was no willful conduct with the specific intent to violate a federally protected right.” “This was a simple street encounter and race wasn’t an issue,” he said. During Garner’s fatal police encounter on July 17, he raised both hands in the air and told the officers not to touch him. Seconds later, a video shows an officer behind Garner grab him in a chokehold and pull him to the sidewalk, rolling him onto his stomach. “I can’t breathe! I can’t breathe!” Garner said repeatedly, his cries muffled into the pavement. Garner, 43, was pronounced dead that day. Police had suspected Garner of selling cigarettes illegally. Eric Garner: The haunting last words of a dying man As part of the federal investigation, FBI agents have visited the scene of Garner’s death. They’re also interviewing witnesses as well as reviewing witness testimony, the senior official said. The investigation is overseen by the federal prosecutor’s office in Brooklyn. The agents will also look over evidence from the NYPD’s internal affairs investigation and may ask to interview officers and emergency medical technicians who responded, the official said. Another aspect of the probe will be whether a chokehold was in fact used in restraining Garner, the senior official said. The cause of Garner’s death was “compression of neck (chokehold), compression of chest and prone positioning during physical restraint by police,” the medical examiner’s office has said. The death was ruled a homicide. The medical examiner also listed acute and chronic bronchial asthma, obesity and hypertensive cardiovascular disease as contributing factors in Garner’s death. The grand jury was made up of 14 white and nine nonwhite members, according to law enforcement sources. A total of 12 jurors who heard all the evidence must be in agreement for a decision. Videos document Garner’s last moments The case became emblematic of longstanding tensions between police and minority communities, especially given that the majority of people stopped under the NYPD’s former “stop-and-frisk” police policy were African-American or Hispanic. A federal court ruled that stop-and-frisk was unconstitutional and tantamount to racial profiling. Garner’s death led to demonstrations around the city and came weeks before the racially charged police shooting of unarmed teen Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Separate grand jury decisions declining to prosecute police officers in connection with both deaths sparked national protests that sometimes involved clashes with police. After the death, Pantaleo was put on modified assignment and stripped of his badge and gun amid the investigation, and the NYPD commissioner ordered an extensive review of training procedures. Two lawsuits have previously been filed against Pantaleo. The plaintiffs in both suits allege false arrest, unlawful imprisonment, civil rights violations and other charges. One suit from 2013 was dismissed in January 2014, while the second, from February 2014, remains open.",4469,Shimon Prokupecz,0.129,0.833,0.038,-0.9969

But it wasn’t a paintball gun. It was a .22-caliber Magnum revolver. And the 9-month-old boy didn’t survive. Authorities are trying to figure out what led to Monday’s shooting in Elmo, in the northwest corner of Missouri. “At this point foul play is not suspected, and it appears at this time that the shooting was accidental,” the Nodaway County Sheriff’s Office said. Sheriff Darren White told CNN affiliate KCTV that the baby was in a playpen when his brother found the gun lying around a bed. When emergency crews arrived, they found the infant had been shot in the head. The child was flown to Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City, Missouri, where he was pronounced dead, the station reported. Authorities say the gun belongs to a relative, but not the mother. Police are investigating the gun’s ownership, KCTV reported. The mother’s other three children are with relatives, according to the station. The sheriff said guns are rampant in the rural community. “We are big supporters of firearms around here,” White told CNN affiliate KETV. “We have a lot of people that own weapons. They hunt. They target shoot. … Most people are very safe with them, and this is one of those cases where everything went together in the wrong way.” He added, “We got some guys that work here that have little kids of their own. … This kind of hits home with them, too. They take it personally.” Though they say the shooting was accidental, authorities have not determined whether charges will be filed against any adult in the case. At least one nearby resident told KCTV she believes the shooting could have been easily prevented. “You know, just some gun safety could have come into play, and would have maybe, you know prevented the situation, but it’s just really sad, altogether,” neighbor Jessica Hutchison said. According to Project ChildSafe, gun owners should lock unloaded weapons in a safe, vault or cabinet inaccessible to children. Gun locks should be used in addition to safe storage, and ammunition should be locked away separately from any firearm. Parents should also teach their children that if they find a gun in a house, they should leave it where it is and tell an adult, even if the weapon resembles a toy, the advocacy group says. Monday’s incident is the latest in a series of high-profile shootings involving children. Among them, a 4-year-old girl killed her cousin, also 4, in Detroit while playing with a gun found under a bed last January, a 9-year-old accidentally killed a shooting instructor in August while firing a submachine gun at an Arizona range and last month a 2-year-old fatally shot his mother in an Idaho Walmart after finding a gun in her purse.",2775,Holly Yan,0.172,0.757,0.071,-0.9961

Residents in nearby cities were told not to drink the tap water, which some said smelled like diesel. The massive oil spill happened when the 12-inch pipeline, which crosses the Yellowstone River, ruptured Saturday about 5 miles upstream from Glendive, Montana’s Department of Environmental Quality said. The Bridger Pipeline company shut down the pipeline. Glendive City Council member Gerald Reichert was among the residents who noticed a disturbing odor in the drinking water. “Suddenly at our house there was a definite smell. It was a diesel smell,” Reichert told the Grand Forks Herald. Montana Gov. Steve Bullock announced a state of emergency for  Dawson and Richland counties. And while officials wait for results from water sample testing, they’re advising residents to use bottled water for drinking and cooking. A host of agencies have responded to the oil spill, including the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Health and Human Services. Adding to the problems, the weather: the Yellowstone River is partially frozen, making it difficult to clean up the mess. This isn’t the first major oil spill into the Yellowstone River – the longest undammed river in the United States. In 2011, up to 42,000 gallons poured out of a ruptured Exxon Mobil pipeline.",1439,Holly Yan,0.065,0.882,0.053,-0.4767

Anna Stoehr of Plainview, Minnesota, gained widespread attention in October when she said she’d had to lie about her age to sign up for the social network. Facebook responded by celebrating her impressive longevity on her birthday. “She turned 114 in October of this year and received a huge bouquet of 114 flowers from Facebook after they learned that she was not able to sign up without putting in a fake age of 90 or 95,” Harlan Stoehr, her 84-year-old eldest son, told CNN on Tuesday. He told CNN that his mother – who leaves 5 children, 27 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren – died Sunday. No phone, no car, no electricity She was born in 1900, the year before the assassination of President William McKinley and the death of Queen Victoria. Her family had no telephone, car or electricity at the time. Facebook isn’t set up to accommodate such venerable users. The network’s sign-up page only allows people to put dates of birth going back to 1905. Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg had attempted to reach Anna Stoehr after his company sent an apology about the age restriction, according to her daughter-in-law Marlene Stoehr. “She was not available when he had his assistant call to get hold of her because of a medical appointment, and then Mark Zuckerberg was out of the country so it never happened,” she said. “But it was an exciting time for everyone with all the attention.” The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment Wednesday. Lived on a farm until she was 112 Facebook isn’t the only area where Anna Stoehr stood out – she was also the oldest person in Minnesota. She even threw out the first pitch at a Minnesota Twins game (via a video-taped throw) at the age of 113, according to her son. “They asked her if she would pitch it overhand or underhand, and she said, ‘Overhand, of course, it’s baseball,’” he said. Harlan Stoehr said his mother was always very active and had lived on a farm near Elgin, Minnesota, from 1936 until 2013. She was left alone there after the death of her husband in 1998. At the age of 112, she moved to an apartment in a retirement community in Plainview. “She loved gardening and always had huge flower gardens and strawberries,” her son said. “She grew all kinds of things, and when an apple tree on her farm blew down, she planted another one. She was 105 years old at the time.” Signed up for Facebook at 113 Her interest in getting onto Facebook at the age of 113 grew out of a friendship with a Verizon salesman. Joseph Ramireza was selling an iPhone to Stoehr’s 85-year-old son, who started talking about his mother. Ramireza said he had to meet her. “She’s become something of a kindred spirit,” Ramireza told CNN affiliate KARE-TV in October. He helped her use FaceTime to video chat with friends on an iPad and has been teaching her to use email and Google search. When Facebook didn’t have her birth year as an option, Ramireza helped Stoehr write a letter to Zuckerberg – on a typewriter. “I’m still here,” she said in the letter.",3125,Jethro Mullen,0.051,0.884,0.066,0.7067

Fifty percent say they approve of the job Obama’s doing as President, according to a Washington Post/ABC News poll released yesterday. Improving economic conditions may be the reason why, but still, 56% of Americans feel the country is on the wrong track. Tonight’s speech will focus on middle-class economics. The President will propose a $500 tax credit for married couples, a child care tax credit increase to $3,000 and two free years of community college to qualified applicants. Ransom: The militant group ISIS has threatened to kill two Japanese citizens unless Tokyo hands over $200 million within 72 hours. Already in the Middle East,  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the international community needs to “deal with terrorists without giving into them.” But he stopped short of explicitly ruling out the payment of a ransom or negotiations with the hostages’ captors. “The government of Japan will make maximum efforts for the early release of the Japanese citizens in cooperation with relevant countries,” the country’s Foreign Ministry said. In a video posted online today, a masked man dressed in black and holding a knife stands over two kneeling men in orange jumpsuits. From coast to coast: The Martin Luther King Jr. Day demonstrations took on a new vigor this year after the deaths of Michael Brown and Eric Garner – two black men who were killed by white police officers. The protests were nonviolent, but they still caused their share of disruptions. Demonstrators partially closed the San Mateo Bridge in the San Francisco Bay area. In nearby Oakland, marchers shut down a subway station. Seattle protesters danced in and out of traffic, challenging authorities to corral them. Surprised? A full four years before North Korea allegedly hacked into Sony Pictures, the U.S. was cracking into North Korean computer networks and keeping an eye on its hackers, The New York Times reported yesterday. It was the information collected through the classified National Security Agency program that helped U.S. intelligence officials figure out Pyongyang’s involvement in the cyberattack, the report says. The U.S. hit North Korea with new economic sanctions afterward, and North Korea also experienced widespread Internet outages in late December, which it blamed on Washington. The U.S. was mum on the matter. He said what? It seems you can always count on Pope Francis for a head-turning quote. On his way back from the Philippines, he hit us with this one on birth control. While not advocating artificial methods, Francis said that parents shouldn’t procreate endlessly, counting on God to work things out for them. “Some think that, excuse me if I use that word, that in order to be good Catholics, we have to be like rabbits. No. Responsible parenthood.” There you go. All you need to know to get an early start to your morning.

Pyle had not been heard from on Monday, and his colleagues at ScienceLogic were “hoping for a miracle,” CNN affiliate WJLA reported. Heavy equipment was brought in to aid in the search for victims and clues, a process that could take days. When the first firefighters arrived on the scene, they received conflicting reports about whether the family may have been out of town. But after interviews with relatives, “it has been determined that six members of the family are not accounted for,” the Anne Arundel County Fire Department said. Fire officials said they were alerted to the fire about 3:30 a.m. Monday. About 80 firefighters responded. The ATF national response team responded because the fire was deemed suspicious, Howarth said. The burned-out home is being treated as a crime scene until investigators figure out the cause, the official said. The fire department said crews had difficulty putting out the fire because the house is secluded, apparently with no fire hydrants on the scene. Photos the fire department posted on Twitter showed hoses stretched for long distances. Davies said it took hours for fire department tanker trucks and a fire boat on an adjacent creek to bring the fire under control.

Don’t drive. Just don’t do it, fire and police officials are urging. They said every surface is slick: Bridges, overpasses, interstates. A photo on the Danbury Fire Police Facebook page shows a lighted road sign that says, “The roads are wicked slippery!” Pennsylvania Department of Transportation spokesman Charles Metzger said conditions will warm as the day goes on, but it will continue to rain throughout the day. Two people have died in accidents related to black ice in the Philadelphia area, state police said. After crashing into at least 20 cars piled up on Interstate 76, one person was killed after getting out of a car and being hit by an oncoming vehicle,  authorities said. Black ice coated Interstate 95 near the city, law enforcement told CNN, and there was an accident at every mile marker. Pile-ups shut down parts of both interstates, a dispatcher said. At least one person has died in Harford County, Maryland, said State Police spokesman Greg Shipley. There were dozens of crashes Sunday throughout central and northern Maryland. Most occurred in Howard, Baltimore, Harford and Cecil counties. Troopers who had worked through the night kept working when their shifts were over, and more troopers were called in to help assist passengers who had accidents, he said. Statewide, Shipley estimates that at least 100 car accidents have occurred. “The State Highway Administration is out in force salting” bridges, ramps and overpasses, he said. The slick roads are causing the highest number of traffic accidents this winter in New Jersey, said State Police Sgt.  Jeff Flynn. There have been 428 accidents and 186 calls to help people who have been in accidents in areas that the police are patrolling, he said Sunday morning. There could be other accidents the department isn’t aware of yet. “So this isn’t even the whole picture,” Flynn told CNN. Even a salt truck slid and crashed into three cars East Orange, New Jersey, according to CNN affiliate News12.

Signing the new agreement means they will abide by new rules the university instated following a tense discussion over sexual assault and binge drinking at fraternities, sparked by a now-discredited article in Rolling Stone magazine depicting a gang rape at one fraternity house. In the article, a then-first-year named Jackie described a rape by seven members of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity at UVA in September 2012. But Charlottesville police have since said that there is no indication that Jackie was raped at the fraternity house. Two days after the article came out in November, but before it was widely criticized for factual errors, UVA suspended all fraternities and sororities, allowing them to reopen social activities in January only under the new terms. Those new safety measures include having security at parties, sober brothers, keys to each room, monitors at the stairs and eliminating pre-mixed drinks. But Alpha Tau Omega and Kappa Alpha Order released statements on their national fraternity letterhead stating they would not sign the new agreement. Late Friday, up against the deadline, they relented. “It is extraordinarily disappointing to see a university of this caliber sacrifice the ideals of freedom of association and due process on the altar of public opinion,” the chapters said in a joint statement. “The University has made it clear in writing today that our organizations will remain suspended if we do not sign the new FOA immediately and have rejected our requests for an extension to continue discussing our concerns.” All of the university’s 31 Greek organizations have now signed the agreement. Phi Kappa Psi, the fraternity slammed in the article, was the first to sign, the university said. Alpha Tau Omega and Kappa Alpha Order said that they will keep fighting the new rules. “The fact that our chapters are signing the [agreement] does not alleviate the coercion, duress or other wrongdoing of the University through this entire process. Given the University’s poor handling of this matter, we are now exploring the right to pursue any legal remedies.” While police have seemingly cleared Phi Kappa Psi, they have not ended their investigation. They have also not said if they believe Jackie may have been raped elsewhere. Rolling Stone apologized for the inaccuracies in the article, which was written by freelance journalist Sabrina Rubin Erdely, and launched an investigation of its own.

Sentinel Police Chief Louis Ross was shot Thursday morning after he entered a house looking for the person who allegedly phoned in a bomb threat to a Head Start center, CNN affiliate KFOR reported. Ross was shot by the man living in the house, KFOR said. The chief had just donned a protective vest, which is credited with saving his life, the OSBI said in a press release. His condition was not available Saturday night. “The man who shot and wounded the Sentinel police chief will not be arrested at this time,” the release said. “OSBI investigators have extensively interviewed the man. Facts surrounding the case lead agents to believe the man was unaware it was officers who made entry.” “We almost lost a good man,” Sentinel Mayor Sam Dlugonski told KFOR. Sentinel, population 900, is about 100 miles from Oklahoma City. The OSBI said somebody called 911 about 4 a.m. Thursday to report a bomb had been placed in the Head Start center. While a bomb squad searched the building and didn’t find any explosives, the chief and deputies went to the home where they thought the bomb threat originated, the OSBI said. “They made entry, cleared the first bedroom, started to clear the second bedroom, he opened fire on police and shot our chief three times in the chest and once in the arm,” Dlugonski told KFOR. The resident, who was not hurt, surrendered to police after the shooting. In a press release issued Friday, the OSBI said it had determined the bomb threat call did not originate from the man’s house. Dlugonski said the caller used the resident’s name, KFOR reported. KFOR reported that officers entered the house without a search warrant. One Sentinel resident said he understood why the shooting happened. “This is country, this ain’t Oklahoma City,” Jimmy Rhoades told KFOR. “You’re taught from a young age that if somebody comes into your house to shoot.” Ross was wearing a protective vest loaned to him by a Washita County deputy, the OSBI said. “The vest saved Ross’s life,” the OSBI said.",2163,Ralph Ellis,0.055,0.863,0.082,0.8712

Stuart Loory, 82, died Friday in his home in Brooklyn, New York, after battling cancer. In addition to working as a correspondent, Loory oversaw CNN bureaus in Washington and Moscow. He later became a vice president of Turner Broadcasting System. But it hardly sums up his life, which was about following his passion for a good story to various points on the map. “Stu was an excellent journalist and a great friend,” CNN founder Ted Turner said Saturday. “He was instrumental in helping to launch the first Goodwill Games in Moscow, a loyal executive and leader at ‘CNN World Report’ and, of course, was well-known as one of the finest bureau chiefs at CNN, running the first Washington, D.C.  bureau and later opening the Moscow bureau. He will be sorely missed.” “He was the consummate journalist,” said his son, Josh Loory, who also became a news producer. Stuart Loory got his start in the mid-1950s as a newspaper reporter at the Newark Evening News, which is no longer in print. In 1958, he moved to Vienna, Austria, on a Pulitzer travel fellowship, and took the family with him, his son said. Josh was 3 months old then. In the course of his father’s career, he would attend eight different schools in 12 years as they hopped between Moscow, Washington, New York, Chicago and Atlanta. “The people that he knew and the circles that he traveled in were absolutely amazing,” his son said. Josh Loory remembers sailing with former Secretary of State and diplomacy icon Henry Kissinger. Before coming to CNN, Loory ran various operations for major daily newspapers. He reported on the White House for the Los Angeles Times. “He covered the end of the (Lyndon) Johnson administration and the (Richard) Nixon administration,” his son said. “Loory was included on (Richard) Nixon’s ‘enemies list’ of political opponents,” according to his biography on the website of the University of Missouri, where he taught from 1997 on after leaving CNN. He had a passion for science, which he wrote about at The New York Times. “He covered every manned space flight from Mercury through Gemini,” his son said. Later, Loory covered NASA space shuttle flights for CNN. Before making the switch to TV journalism for CNN in 1980, he was managing editor of the Chicago Sun-Times. CNN sent him back to Moscow. Former CNN News Group Chairman Tom Johnson said, “He never backed away from asking heads of state the most difficult questions. I saw that firsthand in White House press conferences with President Johnson, and in the Kremlin with both Presidents Gorbachev and Yeltsin. “Stuart was instrumental in obtaining exclusive CNN coverage with Russian television as President Gorbachev resigned from office. He also was instrumental in arranging exclusive CNN-Russian television‎’s first interview with Boris Yeltsin after Yeltsin took office.” In the bitter cold of Moscow, Loory once reported wearing a huge hat and received a message telling him he’d look better if he left it off. Loory answered with a funny TV report advocating for his giant, bushy Russian fur hat. Loory faced danger on the job, as when he covered the civil rights movement in Alabama in the 1960s. “In Montgomery, he witnessed the beating the Freedom Riders got,” said another son, Adam Loory. “He said someone helped him get away from the melee by saying, ‘Take off your tie and glasses and follow me.’ When he realized he was leaving the scene, he said, ‘Take me back, I have to follow the story.’ Back at the bus station, he found John Lewis on the ground bleeding and helped get him to a hospital.” Josh Loory said his father was a family man – and an all-round journalist. He wanted to look out for the downtrodden, Josh Loory said.  “He liked to shine the light of the media where it needed to be shined.” He is survived by his wife and three children.

She and her boyfriend, Jonathan Caughey, were in love and along with her young son Braiden, they were excited to become a family. The only distraction was her aching knee, which began bothering her in spring 2012. Bridges described the “multiple trips” to the doctor’s office. “The first appointment was like, ‘I think there’s something wrong with my knee. It’s achy sometimes but then it goes away.’ “ The doctor told her it was probably just arthritis or bursitis. Then she went back a couple of months later and was told it’s “something you’re going to have to live with.” This went on for over a year until finally Bridges, who lives in Menifee, California, could not walk anymore and was referred to a specialist in October 2013. But before she made it to the specialist, the pain became so intense she had to go to the hospital. “I had excruciating pain in my knee and my toes went numb. So I went to the hospital and they did an X-ray,” she said. They had just wheeled Bridges back to the waiting room to wait for the results when they rushed her back into a room and said the doctor needed to speak with her. The doctor came in and said, “You have bone cancer.” A cancer known as osteosarcoma. She was just 24 years old and in shock from the news. Bridges couldn’t believe what she was hearing, “I was like, no. ‘Cause who thinks of when their knee hurts that they have bone cancer?” Bridges still gets emotional when she talks about how long it took to get her eventual diagnosis. “I’m angry,” Bridges said, tears welling in her eyes, “but there’s really nothing we can do about it now. The doctor that I went to repeatedly and repeatedly telling him something wasn’t right probably cost me my life. This is a very aggressive cancer. I could have had more time.” Bridges underwent surgery to replace her knee and remove the majority of her femur. The doctors also said she should start chemotherapy immediately, but there was a very big risk. Bridges was already 10 weeks pregnant with a baby girl. “They told me what would likely happen to Paisley, that you know, she most likely wouldn’t make it and I just knew. It wasn’t a choice to me. It was like this is what needs to be done. She’s first. I’m not going to kill a healthy baby because I’m sick. There’s nothing wrong with her. Her life is just as important as mine if not more important. I mean as a mother my job is to protect my kids.” Unwavering in her decision to delay treatment – a choice that could ultimately cost her life – she knew Caughey and her mother would support her no matter what. Bridges’ mother, Renee Thomas, said her daughter has always been strong-willed and this decision didn’t surprise her. “I always tell her it’s not over ‘til it’s over,” she said. “You never know. We might get that miracle” But after giving birth to Paisley in July, a full body scan revealed the cancer had spread throughout Bridges’ body, even into her brain. “When they told me that, I think oh my gosh, I am really dying. I’m not going to beat this. And then I am sad for about a week and then I get back to OK, well it’s not over yet. And then I’ll be good and then I’ll get some more bad news that it spread through my whole entire body. And then that will knock me down for about a week and then I’ll bounce back.” But Bridges admits it’s hard to be in pain all the time. Bridges’ doctors say she has months to live, but she still has goals. “I am really pushing for Paisley’s first birthday. This is what I do. I do October, OK, I just got to make it to Thanksgiving. Thanksgiving comes around – OK, let’s just go to Christmas. Then Christmas comes and Braiden’s birthday is in March, so I’m going to make it to Braiden’s birthday. I’m just going to keep setting little goals for myself and we’ll see.” 24-year-old cancer victim inspires after death After the terminal diagnosis, Bridges and Caughey moved their wedding date up a couple of months to this past November. Bridges brightens when she talks about her wedding day. Braiden, 6, got to walk her down the aisle. “It just went by so fast. If I could sum that day up it would just be magical. Magical. Loved it. Loved seeing all my friends, my family all together.” Lindsey Natzic-Villatoro, owner of Love Song Events and Photography, planned the wedding in just a few weeks and has become a source of support for Bridges and her family. She also has photographed Bridges’ recent milestones – from her pregnancy and the newborn to her engagement and holiday pictures – documenting many of life’s firsts. Natzic-Villatoro, a mother of three, sees Bridges as the perfect example of what motherhood is all about. “I think that this has helped express to others who have never had children the depth of actually a mom’s love – the selflessness. It’s just like the best example that she has shown the entire world.

Ali, who has Parkinson’s disease and received follow-up care for a urinary tract infection this week at an undisclosed hospital, was released as expected Friday, the day before his 73rd birthday. Bob Gunnell said Ali is looking forward to gathering with family and friends to watch a college basketball game Saturday between the Duke Blue Devils and his hometown team, the Louisville Cardinals. His family thanked fans in a written statement for “the outpouring of support and continued well wishes.” Ali was initially released from the hospital on January 7 after an 18-day stay. Born Cassius Clay, the fighter won an Olympic gold medal as a light-heavyweight at 18. In 1964, he became world heavyweight champion in an upset victory over Sonny Liston. Shortly thereafter, he changed his name to Muhammad Ali to reflect his conversion to Islam. The boxer was also known for his protest against the Vietnam War and refusing to be drafted on religious grounds. He won his first 31 professional fights before losing to Joe Frazier in 1971, a bout hailed by some boxing experts as one of the greatest of all time. He retired from boxing in 1981 as a three-time heavyweight champion and announced his diagnosis with Parkinson’s three years later.",1356,Steve Almasy,0.076,0.774,0.15,0.9628

63,63,01/16/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/16/us/navy-carrier-disposal/index.html,Group makes last-ditch effort to save ‘Top Gun’ carrier,US,CNN,"In the climactic final battle in the 1986 movie “Top Gun,” an officer tells Stinger, the battle commander, that the aircraft carrier’s catapults are broken and it’s unable to launch planes. Stinger asks how long a fix will take. “It’ll take 10 minutes,” the officer replies. “Bull—- 10 minutes! This thing will be over in two minutes! Get on it!” Stinger says. Fast-forward to 2015, and the fate of the carrier in “Top Gun” is in similar peril. The USS Ranger, decommissioned by the Navy in 1993, is scheduled to be towed from storage in Bremerton, Washington, to a wrecking yard in Texas in about a month. Coming in with a bid to save it is Top Gun Super Carrier of Long Beach, which hopes to stop the carrier’s final journey in the California port city, with hopes to turn it into a tourist and business destination. “Right now, we just want a stay of execution,” Michael B. Shanahan, project manager for the Long Beach rescue effort, said in a statement on a Change.org petition to save the carrier. “This is our last chance to stop the loss of an irreplaceable cultural and historic asset.” That chance appears to be slim. In December, the Navy paid International Shipbreaking of Brownsville, Texas, a penny to take the 56,000-ton warship off its hands. The shipbreaker makes its profit by selling the parts of the ship for scrap. Although the Ranger was decommissioned in 1993, the Navy kept it around for possible reactivation until March 2004, when it was stricken from the Naval Register and made available for donation to a group that could preserve it. An attempt by the USS Ranger Foundation to turn the carrier into a museum in Oregon fell short financially, and it could not figure out a way to get the huge ship up the Columbia River to Fairview, Oregon, according to a Navy statement. When it finalized the contract to scrap the Ranger in December, the Navy said it could not afford to maintain it indefinitely while waiting for a suitable organization to take it over. Shanahan said the Top Gun group will cover all costs to keep the Ranger from the scrapyard. “Sparing the ship now presents NO financial risk to the federal government,” he said in a statement. The group says it has secured $14 million in donations so far and will cover the $200,000 in annual maintenance costs until a permanent berth for the ship is found, according to a story in the Long Beach Post. But Chris Johnson, a spokesman for Naval Sea Systems Command, which was responsible for disposing of the carrier, told the Navy Times that the Top Gun plan wouldn’t pass muster. “We cannot take private funding for inherently military purposes, so it’s not accurate when the group says it can raise funds to keep the ship on donation hold,” the Navy Times quoted Johnson as saying. So unless another plan comes together quickly, the Ranger is likely to follow two of its predecessors in the Forrestal class of carriers – the Forrestal and the Saratoga – to scrapyards in Brownsville. Another carrier, the USS Constellation, part of the Kitty Hawk class, was towed to Brownsville late last year. Like the Ranger, the Constellation was stored in Washington and because of its size had to be towed all the way around the southern tip of South America, as it would not fit through the Panama Canal. The Ranger’s final journey is expected to take four to five months, the Navy says. The Ranger spent more than 35 years on active service, including missions off Vietnam and in support of Operation Desert Storm.",3492,Brad Lendon,0.042,0.892,0.066,0.93

But they say they didn’t realize what was happening – until it was too late. “For the past few months, he was very quiet and he wanted isolation because he was watching or doing something on social media. And that’s why he was brainwashed,” Zarine Khan said in an exclusive interview with CNN’s “AC360” Thursday. Now Mohammed Hamzah Khan, 19, is accused of trying to support ISIS. This week he pleaded not guilty to a federal charge of attempting to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization. Outside the courtroom in Chicago, his mother told reporters she had a message for the terror group’s leader: “Leave our children alone.” “They’re misusing the children’s innocence,” Zarine Khan told CNN’s Anderson Cooper Thursday. “The children are gullible. They’re vulnerable. Their thinking skills have not completely developed and these people are preying on that.” ISIS, an extremist Islamist group, has been fighting to take over a swath of territory in Iraq and Syria, where it wants to establish a caliphate or Islamic state. The group regularly uses social media to promote its goals, posting videos of brutal violence and using hashtags for other stories in the news to disseminate its message. Authorities arrested Mohammed Khan at O’Hare International Airport in October as he was about to embark on a flight to Istanbul. In a letter he left behind for his parents, he wrote that he was leaving the United States and on his way to join ISIS, according to a criminal complaint. He invited them to join him in the “Islamic State,” but he warned them not to tell anyone about his travel plans. The letter shocked them, his mother said. “The things in those letters did not reflect the upbringing they got. Those values, they don’t come from us. It was so out of sync. It was so out of place,” she said. Thomas Durkin, the teen’s attorney, said the case was a sign of “nothing but immaturity.” “There are thousands of kids doing this, and I think that’s part of the point, what’s causing them to do it? I don’t believe, in my client’s case, it’s because he’s a violent person and wants to go kill people,” Durkin said. “I think he was a misguided young man who got manipulated by social media.” During questioning at the airport, Mohammed Khan told FBI agents that a person he met online had given him the phone number of a person to call once he arrived in Istanbul, federal authorities said in October. That person, Khan allegedly told the agents, was to take him to ISIS territory. According to the complaint, Khan told authorities he was planning on being in some type of public service – like a police force – or providing humanitarian work or in a combat role. ISIS has successfully recruited large numbers of foreign fighters from across the globe, including from the United States and Western Europe. Turkey, the complaint notes, is a common transit point for foreign fighters from Western countries who travel to join ISIS. If it weren’t for the Internet, his mother now says, “he would never be in the situation he is in today.” So what’s her message for other parents? “Maybe the mistake we made was maybe we protected our children. We were trying to protect our culture or values. Maybe that was a mistake,” Zarine Khan said. “I would tell them to expose their children more to what’s going on in the world, help them develop critical thinking skills to differentiate between the good and the bad guys.”",3499,Catherine E.

65,65,01/16/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/15/us/oklahoma-resumes-executions/index.html,Botched Oklahoma execution haunts inmate as death nears,US,CNN,"Richard Glossip has spent 17 years in a tiny cell in H Unit of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary, close to the death chamber. Every execution is a reminder that his turn will come one day. He got that reminder again Thursday when Charles Warner became the first inmate to be executed in Oklahoma since last April. That’s when Clayton Lockett died in what was widely seen as a botched lethal injection process. “I’ve seen it on TV,” says Glossip, 51, in a telephone call from death row. He says he’s reconciled with his fate, though he has always maintained his innocence. He says he has long believed that without mental preparation, things will not go well in his final moments. But when he learned that Lockett’s was one of the longest executions in U.S. history and that he moaned and writhed on the gurney for 43 minutes before dying of a heart attack, a new anxiety set in. “I am worried they will botch it again,” he says. The bungled execution horrified people around the world, and the state put a moratorium on carrying out the ultimate punishment until it could fully review what happened. But Oklahoma’s decision to go forth Thursday with a variation of the same drug formula concerned death penalty lawyers who say the state still risks violating the Constitution by inflicting cruel and unusual punishment on inmates. Attorneys for Warner, Glossip and two other Oklahoma inmates facing execution appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday for stays until the new protocol could be evaluated. But the justices voted 5-4 to deny the application. In her dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that she was “deeply troubled” by the continued use of midazolam, a sedative at the heart of the lethal injection controversy. Attorney Dale Baich, one of the lawyers who filed the suit, says the Supreme Court will have to revisit this issue in the near future. “The drugs and drug combinations used in executions today vary tremendously across different jurisdictions,” he says. “This experimentation has led to the predictable but tragic result of multiple botched executions. The court’s guidance on the practices currently employed in lethal injection is urgently needed.” Oklahoma officials say, however, that they have addressed the concerns that surfaced after Lockett and put new equipment and protocol in place. So, shortly after 7 p.m. (8 p.m. ET), in a renovated death chamber, the lethal cocktail began flowing into the veins of Warner, convicted of the first-degree rape and murder of his then-girlfriend’s 11-month-old daughter. He was pronounced dead at 7:28 p.m. Glossip is scheduled to die next, on January 29. Oklahoma spent $71,000 renovating the chamber and the adjacent witness rooms so that executioners have more space. The state also spent $34,000 on new equipment, including a $12,500 gurney that replaced one from the 1950s and an ultrasound machine to help detect veins. But the state did not deem it necessary to change its controversial three-drug formula. Of particular concern is the use of the sedative midazolam, also used in two other executions that went awry: Dennis McGuire agonized for 26 minutes in Ohio, and Joseph Wood gasped more than 600 times and took two hours to die in Arizona. Witnesses in Oklahoma said Lockett regained consciousness after the sedative was administered. They said he grimaced and suffered for many minutes. Lockett’s execution was halted after his IV needle dislodged and spewed blood, but he later died. A state investigation linked the problem to the IV lines not being inserted correctly. This has been a problem in other executions as well. “What they have not done is investigate whether their use of midazolam in the Lockett execution contributed to the fiasco that resulted,” says Richard Dieter, executive director of the Death Penalty Information Center, which does not officially take a position but is widely seen as anti-capital punishment. Oklahoma upped its dosage of midazolam to 500 milligrams, compared with the 100 milligrams Lockett got. But Dieter says there is no proof that increasing the dosage will avoid problems. “They have not shown that this drug will produce the necessary level of unconsciousness to allow the execution to proceed humanely,” he says. Florida uses the same three-drug cocktail and it, too, executed a convicted murderer Thursday after the Supreme Court gave the green light. Johnny Shane Kormondy was declared dead at 8:16 p.m. at the Florida State Prison in Starke. Until 2010, states employed a fairly standard drug formula to carry out the death penalty that included the anesthetic sodium thiopental. But after the sole U.S. manufacturer stopped making the drug and European companies refused to sell it for use in executions, states faced drug shortages for the lethal cocktail and searched desperately for alternatives. Midazolam, commonly used as a sedative before surgery, was first used in Florida in 2011 without any guarantees that the inmate would remain sedated long enough. Witnesses who watched convicted murderer William Happ die said that he remained conscious longer than those who were killed with the old formula. Death penalty opponents say the use of midazolam amounts essentially to experimentation on human beings. But four states use the drug in their lethal injections. The executions Thursday in Oklahoma and Florida began with midazolam. Then the inmates were injected with a paralytic agent to prevent the inmate from flailing, followed by potassium chloride, which stopped their hearts. Glossip thinks about what he might feel after he is strapped into the gurney and the drugs begin coursing through his veins. He has spent the last few weeks imagining a disastrous end like Lockett’s. Helen Prejean, a Catholic nun who ministers to the condemned and has spoken with Glossip, says he is haunted by Lockett’s agony. “He’s scared,” she says: that the sedative won’t do its job, that he will be helpless to stop the pain. It’s difficult for many people to feel any sympathy for a man who was convicted in a hire-for-murder scheme that resulted in the 1997 death of Barry Alan Van Treese, owner of a Best Budget Inn in Oklahoma City. Van Treese’s family appeared at a clemency hearing for Glossip in October and spoke of the many ways they missed a husband, father and brother. They said too often, victims of crime are forgotten in the capital punishment process. “I will speak for my brother,” said Kenneth Van Treese. “It hurts like hell to have your head bashed in with a baseball bat. Do not feel sorry for the bastard who took my life.” Van Treese’s sister, Alana Van Treese Mileto, told the clemency board that the death penalty was not revenge, but the law. But attorneys for death row inmates say Oklahoma’s execution protocol remains unconstitutional. Their appeal to the Supreme Court says the state is relying on a “drug that cannot reliably produce or maintain a deep, comalike unconsciousness.” Baich, one of Warner’s attorneys, says midazolam was not part of the lethal injection protocol approved by the Supreme Court in 2008. Simply increasing the dosage, he says, does not overcome the risk and leaves Oklahoma open to inhumane action. “Oklahoma’s current execution protocol creates a substantial risk of severe pain, needless suffering and a lingering death,” Baich says. CNN contacted the Oklahoma Department of Corrections for comment and was referred to the execution protocol posted on its website. Glossip says he can’t believe Oklahoma resumed the use of a sedative that has been so problematic, one that, ironically, bought him time. He might have been dead already – his initial execution date was set in November – but the state postponed it because it said it wasn’t quite prepared with its new procedures. For a while, Glossip got to leave a special holding cell for the final 35 days before execution and return to his old one, located beneath the death chamber. He was glad for that. In the holding cell, two fluorescent lights glared down on him 24/7. His acrylic glass-wrapped television set was revoked. He was allowed a single book but chose to write letters instead. Many inmates ask for a Bible, he says. At Christmas, he launched a hunger strike. That way, he could have some agency over his death, he thought. But Prejean, who is planning to be with him at his execution, persuaded him to eat. “I feel especially responsible for Richard,” she says. “A few days ago I urged him to eat again so he can fight to expose the horrible injustice, not only for himself but for all who go through this torture.” Glossip has exhausted all appeals of his verdict and sentence. He was tried twice for Van Treese’s killing – the first conviction was tossed because of incompetent legal representation. But a second jury also convicted him. Prosecutors said Glossip hired maintenance worker Justin Sneed to take a baseball bat and bludgeon their boss Van Treese to death because Glossip thought he would be fired. At trial, Sneed testified that he killed Van Treese at Glossip’s behest and received a life sentence. Glossip was sentenced to death. “Twice a jury has heard the evidence against Richard Glossip and twice a jury has convicted him and sentenced him to death for his role in the murder of Barry Van Treese,” says Aaron Cooper, a spokesman for the Oklahoma attorney general. Glossip holds steadfast to his innocence. He says he is being put to death even though the real killer lied and gets to live. “I feel sorry for Barry’s family,” Glossip says. “But I did not commit a crime.” He adds, “At first I was angry at Justin, but now I feel sorry for him. He’s afraid of how Oklahoma will kill him if he owns up to what really happened, just like I am afraid of how they’ll kill me. It’s fear making him lie about what happened.” These days Glossip thinks about his late parents – his mother died just a year ago – and 14 siblings. He thinks about what it would feel like to see green grass and trees again. To smell fresh air. They are things that Van Treese’s family wishes their loved one could see now, too.",10091,Moni Basu,0.213,0.722,0.065,-0.9999
66,66,01/16/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/15/us/nasa-one-year-mission/index.html,Astronaut set to spend one year in space,US,CNN,"NASA is sending astronaut Scott Kelly to live on the International Space Station for a year. That’s the longest any U.S. astronaut has spent in space and twice as long as crew members usually stay on the space station. A year is a long time to stay anyplace. But staying a year in space has some special challenges. There’s what to pack: How many changes of clothes do you bring? Kelly says NASA supplies most of what he needs but he’s taking his own tool pouch, some sweatshirts and special shoes to use when he’s lifting weights. “I bought a special kind of shoes I thought would be better for that,” Kelly said at a NASA briefing on Thursday. Then there’s what to do for a year in space. You get a great view of Earth, so the scenery is amazing. But the space station orbits Earth about every 90 minutes, or about 16 times a day. Could get a little repetitive. So how do you keep from getting bored? Experiments. Lots and lots of experiments. NASA says space station crews normally work on about 200 experiments over six months, but Kelly will be doing many more. He says he’s actually fascinated with the space station itself as a giant experiment in living in space. “Building this facility that allows us to understand how to operate for long periods of time in space to allow us someday to go to Mars.” In his free time Kelly says he’ll spend a lot of time talking to people on Earth, messaging on social media, reading email, watching TV and writing. “I’m going to keep a personal journal of the experience,” Kelly said. He also will share some of his journal with researchers studying the psychological impacts of long-term space flight. Will he tell all? “I plan to be completely honest about it,” he said, but … “who knows, maybe there are some crazy thoughts I’ll have at the end that I wouldn’t want to share.” Kelly also might get to do a bit of singing. British singer Sarah Brightman will visit the station as a space tourist during Kelly’s year in orbit. Will he and the other crew members sing along with her? “It will be either all of us or none of us,” Kelly joked. One other thing Kelly has to plan for: near-zero gravity. Turns out our bodies really like gravity. Stay in orbit too long and your eyes, heart, bones, muscles – basically everything – change, and usually not for the better. On the upside, you get a bit taller. At least briefly. “You do grow when you’re up there for a long time,” Kelly said. “Unfortunately it doesn’t last. But it did last long enough that I could stand next to my brother and look down at him a little bit.” Kelly was joking about his twin, former astronaut Mark Kelly (who is also known for being the husband of former Rep. Gabrielle Giffords). Mark Kelly has volunteered for NASA’s “Twins Study” – 10 investigations into how the identical twins change over the year in two very different environments. Even though Mark will be on Earth getting poked and prodded by researchers while Scott makes history in orbit, Scott said his brother doesn’t mind. “He thinks it’s great that he can still be a participant in this,” Scott Kelly said. The Kelly brothers’ experiments should help NASA understand what happens to astronauts who spend a long time in space and help plan longer spaceflights to an asteroid or to Mars. Despite all the health risks and personal sacrifices, Kelly said there’s a big reason to stay in space a year. “It’s a lot of fun,” he said. “Space station is a magical place.” The mission is a first for NASA, but not for Russia. Between 1987 and 1995, four cosmonauts spent a year or more in space. And another Russian will be with Kelly for his yearlong mission: cosmonaut Mikhail Kornienko. Both men are space veterans. Kelly has flown on two shuttle missions and has already done two stints on the space station. In all, he’s logged more than 180 days in space. Kornienko has spent 176 days in space. The two will ride to the space station on a Russian Soyuz spacecraft along with Russian cosmonaut Gennady Padalka, who is staying for six months. The trio will launch from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan on March 27.",4099,Amanda Barnett,0.017,0.889,0.094,0.9966

Cornell allegedly told that source he had been in contact with persons overseas, and that he had aligned himself with ISIS.

The remarks she writes next on her own personal letterhead dated May 27, 1912, indicate that not all were pleased with how things turned out. “According to the way we’ve been treated by England on our return we didn’t seem to have done the right thing in being saved at all!!!! Isn’t it disgraceful?” Duff-Gordon said. Duff-Gordon and her husband, Cosmo, escaped the Titanic’s tragic end by boarding Lifeboat 1, which transported 12 passengers despite having capacity for 40. The prominent fashion designer and her husband were the only two passengers asked to testify during the British Wreck Commissioner’s inquiry into the famous ship’s sinking.  Their testimony made them popular fodder for tabloids after allegations that Cosmo had bribed the crew to row away faster, rather than trying to rescue others. Lifeboat 1 became known as the “Money Boat.” Rumors that the Duff-Gordons tried to deter the crew from making other rescues were never corroborated, but Lucy Duff-Gordon later said  her husband was “brokenhearted over the negative coverage for the rest of his life,” according to a release from RR Auction, the house responsible for the sale of the letter. Other artifacts also up for auction with Duff-Gordon’s letter include a teacup from the Titanic that was, according to the auction house, “destined for the bottom of the Atlantic,” a guitar belonging to Johnny Ramone of the Ramones, and a three-page letter by Civil Rights activist Malcolm X written from a Norfolk prison in 1950. In his letter, Malcolm X proclaims his allegiance to “the Almighty God, Allah,” whom he credits with “cleaning our polluted souls.” Before converting to Islam in 1948, Malcolm X lived in Boston, where he befriended musicians at the Roseland State Ballroom where he worked.  Though he renounced his former life, saying, “Without Allah, no wonder we have so longingly turned so often to music for its comforting effects,” he wrote longingly of his former friends.

The Colts announced they have placed Joshua McNary, who they signed as a free agent in April 2013, on the Exempt/Commissioner Permission list, so he will not be allowed to play in the team’s upcoming playoff matchups, but he will continue to be paid, in accordance with the National Football League’s updated personal conduct policy. McNary was released early Thursday, according to the Marion County, Indiana, jail website. He posted a $25,000 bond and was ordered to wear an ankle bracelet for GPS monitoring, said Peg McLeish, a spokeswoman for the county prosecuting attorney. He appeared at an initial hearing at which a preliminary not guilty plea was entered for him, she said. His next court date is a March 11 pretrial conference. Defense attorney Edward Schrager said he would not be commenting further on the case, but said in his statement that the charges and affidavit “are not evidence of wrongdoing, but simply one side’s story. “Joshua has full faith and confidence in the American way, including its justice system, which he pledged to protect and defend as a West Point graduate and lieutenant in the United States Army.” McNary, 26, was taken into police custody and charged with felony rape, felony criminal confinement and misdemeanor battery resulting in bodily injury. According to a probable cause affidavit, a 29-year-old woman reported to police on the morning of December 1 that she was raped hours earlier at the apartment of a man she met at a bar. The woman recounted having numerous drinks at three establishments before she arrived at the apartment, and she didn’t remember exactly how she got there, the affidavit says. She recalled “being flirty” and “touchy-feely” as she and the man kissed, she told police. “This wasn’t a problem and it was not aggressive,” she said, according to the affidavit. Soon, though, she told the man that she “needed to lay down” because she was “really drunk,” the affidavit says. She lay in the man’s bed, and he began kissing her, which made her uncomfortable, and she noticed that he had taken his shirt off and she was “completely naked,” she told police. “No. I’m too drunk for this. I need to lay down. I have to work, and I’m not OK with this,” she recalled telling the man, according to the affidavit. She said she told the man several times she didn’t want to have sex and fought with him, scratching him on the face, neck, back and shoulder. The man initially tried to talk her into it, and then forced her to have sex on his bed, she told police. She told the man she wanted to leave on multiple occasions, but he wouldn’t let her, at one point, saying, “You’re gonna stay,” the affidavit says. She eventually left the apartment and mistakenly took the man’s cell phone with her, she told police A forensic nurse examined the woman and found injuries to her vagina and dried blood behind one ear. The document indicates detectives used the cell phone to identify McNary the next day. When police arrived to search his apartment, he pointed to a pile of bedding in front of a washer and told police, “I preserved it for you because I knew you would be coming.” He had also taken photos of the sheets, in particular “blood stains and other soiled areas of the bedding,” the affidavit says. McNary was cooperative, police indicated, and he asked for a lawyer after being advised of his rights. A nurse found abrasions and scratches on his stomach, back, neck and shoulder, the document says. Investigators also found the woman’s clothing and an earring in McNary’s apartment. The Colts said they were aware of the incident, but that was the “limit of our knowledge.” The team was working to gather facts before forming an opinion, the statement said. Colts spokesman Avis Roper said that after reviewing documents surrounding “the very serious criminal charges,” the team asked Commissioner Roger Goodell to place McNary on the exemption list. “If the request is granted, Josh will not be eligible to practice or attend games with the Club while designated as Commissioner Exempt. That designation will permit the investigation provided by the League’s Personal Conduct Policy to run its course and will afford Josh the opportunity to focus on his defense against the charges,” the statement said. A later statement confirmed McNary had been placed on the list. The National Football League said the matter is “under review.” Recently, the NFL revised its personal conduct policy. It includes a minimum six-game suspension for crimes involving violent conduct, including domestic violence and sexual assault. The league reviewed its stance after widespread criticism of its handling of the Ray Rice case. McNary is listed as a second-string inside linebacker for the Colts, who play the New England Patriots on Sunday in the AFC championship game. He has 28 tackles – mostly on special teams – in 15 games this season. The 6-foot, 251-pound player is in his second season. He played college football at Army and served in the military from 2011 to 2013 before joining the Colts.",5211,Eliott C. McLaughlin,0.096,0.84,0.063,-0.9903

A possible ammonia leak in the cooling system had the crew from the American segment of the station move temporarily to the Russian segment. It was a false alarm, NASA said. Tests indicated that the off-scale measurements were the result of a computer failure, and not an ammonia leak. International Space Station program manager Mike Suffredini said the relocation was done as a precaution because of four measurements that were off scale. These measures could have indicated an ammonia leak. The astronauts, as trained, put on masks, moved to the Russian segment, and closed the hatch to the American segment, he said. Two U.S. astronauts are aboard the International Space Station: commander Barry Wilmore and flight engineer Terry Virts. Once it was determined that the emergency was a false alarm, the astronauts still had to wait while equipment on the U.S. segment was powered back up, Suffredini said. NASA tweeted that at 3:05 p.m. ET, the hatch was reopened and the astronauts returned. There was no ammonia in the area, NASA said. The crew was unable to carry out experiments that were planned, but no research was lost, Suffredini said. The Americans were joined by Samantha Cristoforetti, a flight engineer with the European Space Agency, and others in the space station’s six-member crew. “Hey everybody, thanks for your concern,” Cristoforetti tweeted. “We’re all safe & doing well in the Russian segment.”",1569,Mariano Castillo,0.072,0.871,0.057,-0.2805
72,72,01/14/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/14/us/colorado-gay-woman-funeral-service/index.html,Protests at Colorado church over handling of gay woman’s funeral,US,CNN,"Family and friends of a gay woman in Colorado have expressed anger at a church’s refusal to show a video at her funeral that contained images of the woman kissing her partner. The service Saturday for Vanessa Collier in a Denver suburb was abruptly moved to a funeral home across the street after mourners had already arrived at the church, according to family and friends of the deceased woman. “People started taking their seats at 10 a.m.” at New Hope Ministries church, Jose Silva, a friend of Collier’s and spokesman for the family, told CNN affiliate KMGH. “At 10:15, the pastor said, ‘Due to technical difficulties, the funeral is being moved.’” The reason for the sudden change was a tribute video about Collier, who died December 29 at the age of 33. Pastor Ray Chavez of the church, New Hope Ministries, asked the family if they would be willing to edit out the images of Collier kissing her partner, said Gary Rolando, the chaplain who conducted the service. “The family graciously declined” and asked to move the service to the funeral home across the street, Rolando told KMGH. “They didn’t want to edit her life,” Silva said. But at the funeral home, “… the room was too small to accommodate everyone so people were standing and sitting on the floor as well as flooded out into the lobby and had to watch the service on a TV screen,” Christina Higley, Collier’s partner, said in a statement. New Hope Ministries didn’t respond to requests for comment about what happened. Silva and other friends protested Tuesday outside the church in Lakewood, Colorado, holding signs saying, “Dignity in Death Vanessa” and “You will not find Jesus at New Hope but you will find HYPOCRISY.” They are demanding an apology from Chavez. “Vanessa was disrespected at what was to be a time to celebrate her life,” Collier’s friends wrote in a Facebook post about their protest. Rolando, another friend of Collier’s family, said New Hope Ministries “dropped the ball” by misplacing the video that the family originally gave them the day before the funeral. “They lost the video and asked for another copy,” he told KMGH. “When it was reviewed, they realized there was content that involved kissing.” Rolando said the church had passed the $400 fee that the family paid for the service to the funeral home. The family wants their money back, Silva said. The family spokesman told CNN the church knew in advance that Collier was a lesbian, and that fact alone wasn’t why the funeral ended up being moved. If the family had known about the need to change the video ahead of time, they “could have rectified this situation,” he said. Silva added: “This is unacceptable. Everybody should have dignity in death.” Collier and her partner had two daughters, ages 12 and 7. “Having to explain to them why we had to leave was completely heartbreaking,” Higley wrote. “New Hope is very sorry,” Rolando said. “It’s very sad that it happened the way that it did.” The church’s website says it is “a place where those bound by drugs, alcohol, gangs and violence can find an ‘Ounce of Hope.’” One churchgoer told KMGH that she thinks Chavez has no need to apologize. “The pastor stood for what he believes in, and he believes in God’s truth,” said Anita Luna. “He’s not wrong, he’s right in what he did.” But Silva, who says New Hope is a church he “once called home,” disagrees. “This is about not being able to have dignity in death for one of God’s children,” he told CNN affiliate KDVR. “No matter what the circumstances – if you’re black, white, brown, gay, lesbian, transgender – we all deserve that. And the church did not afford that to us.”",3627,Jethro Mullen,0.102,0.799,0.099,-0.4231
73,73,01/14/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/13/us/jihadi-rap/index.html,The terrorist recruiting crossroads:  Where jihad meets rap,US,CNN,"It’s a strange brew – jihad and rap.  Strange, but powerful. Rap videos supporting the Islamist ideals of jihad are popping up all over the Internet.  They have names like “Blow by Blow” and “Dirty Kuffar.” The videos espouse an us-against-the-world mentality, with a heavy infusion of Islamist extremism. The songs have been doing the rounds for some time. But they’re getting renewed since the Paris attacks last week. That’s because long before Cherif Kouachi and his brother killed 12 people in the attack on Charlie Hebdo headquarters in Paris, he was a petty thief and an aspiring rapper. In 2005, France 3 TV featured  Kouachi in a documentary about recruiting young Islamic extremists.  In it, the reporter says Kouachi prefers rap and pretty girls to attending mosque. That’s before he was radicalized and received training in the Middle East While it’s not clear if he ever rapped about jihad, Kouachi was certainly part of a culture of Muslim youth in Paris who felt marginalized in society. The development is alarming to security analysts, who see the videos being used as a recruiting tool. “This is an effort … to make these groups more approachable to potential recruits in places the Britian or France or America who are susceptible to rap videos but who might feel that the beheading videos we’ve seen in the past are too extreme,” said Philip Mudd, a CNN counterterrorism expert. In “Dirty Kuffar” by Sheikh Terra and featuring Soul Salah Crew, there are shoutouts to Osama bin Laden and fundamentalist groups Hamas and Hezbollah. The video also rages against Kuffar, non-believers.  Prime examples are Ronald Reagan, Tony Blair and George W. Bush. Blow by Blow” was created by Alabama native Omar Shafik Hammami. He was on the FBI’s most-wanted terrorist list before he was killed in Somalia in 2013. His rhymes stick to jihadi propaganda.  “Land by land, war by war, only gonna make our black flag soar.” Still, it seems like a bit of a stretch – the excesses often exhibited by hip hop, especially in some videos, paired with the sparseness of fundamentalist Islam. Amil Kahn, who has written extensively about the crossroads of rap and jihad, thinks he knows where the appeal comes from. “They are saying they are the good guys,” he said.  “They are fighting for justice for people who are oppressed, and rap is also and has been historically a form of getting that idea across to people.” Jihadists aren’t the first to borrow the genre for their own purposes. Neo-Nazi groups have used white power rap as a recruitment tool, especially in Germany For now, jihadi rap videos exist only on the very extreme edges of the genre and only a relatively small number are out there. In 2012: Iranian rapper faces death threats, bounty over song But not surprisingly, industry leaders like L. Londell McMillan, publisher of The Source, a magazine that focuses on hip-hop culture, aren’t exactly enamored with the notion that terrorist groups are hijacking the art form. “For me personally, whether it’s jihadi rap or gangster rap, I’m very upset with how rap is being used in any way that is harmful and hurts people,’ he said.

74,74,01/14/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/10/us/spacex-rocket-launch/index.html,"SpaceX booster landing test fails, but rocket goes on successfully",US,CNN,"In spite of a successful rocket launch on Saturday, things didn’t quite work out as SpaceX had hoped, when it tried to make history with an experiment. The Falcon 9 rocket lifted off as scheduled at 4:47 a.m. ET from Cape Canaveral, Florida, on a routine mission to resupply the International Space Station. What went up is doing fine. What came down didn’t quite, but the the rocket scientists were almost counting on that, and they’re not too disappointed. The company tried to land the first section of the rocket, which is 14 stories tall, back down gingerly and on its feet on Earth, while the rest of the rocket continued on. A floating landing pad was waiting out in the Atlantic ocean for the booster. It made it there, but came down a little too hard, SpaceX founder Elon Musk said in a tweet. “Rocket made it to drone spaceport ship, but landed hard. Close, but no cigar this time.” Don’t lose it; reuse it Normally, once it has vaulted the rest of the rocket to space, the huge booster falls back into the ocean as, basically, garbage. That has been compared to throwing away a Boeing 747 passenger jet after it makes one transatlantic flight. But SpaceX has been determined to change the practice to save millions in costs. Instead of losing the biggest part of the rocket, the company aims to reuse it. The Falcon 9 is made up of two sections, called stages, that contain engines. On top of the rocket is the capsule, which carries its payload. It could also carry astronauts some day. After the launch – then the separation from the second stage of the rocket – the Falcon 9 rocket’s booster turned around to head back down to the floating platform. The company logo’s signature “X” marked the spot in the middle of a bull’s eye on the black tarmac of the “spaceport drone ship” that plowed through the water autonomously – with no need of human drivers, who could get hurt in a bang-up. Some stuff on the ship did get dinged when the rocket plunked down on it, Musk said in a tweet. Second try The originally planned launch on Tuesday was scrubbed due to technical issues that turned up in the rocket’s second stage. Scratching a launch time is routine for the space industry – sometimes due to weather, sometimes for technical reasons. As Musk said when a different model rocket self-detonated as a safety measure during a soft-landing test in August: “Rockets are tricky.” The official mission Though the landing was a test, the launch was not. The “Dragon” capsule is carrying a payload of up to about 5,000 pounds to the ISS. With five previous trips, the resupply missions have become somewhat routine. And this one appeared to be going as planned on Saturday. The Dragon will land back on Earth the usual way in four and a half weeks, plopping into ocean water, after blazing back through the atmosphere with red-hot heat shields glowing at up to 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The historic part SpaceX has tried the landing experiment before, with the exception of the last step. If the Falcon 9’s booster had pulled off the landing on the platform, that would have been historic. In previous experiments, engineers brought it down softly into the water. Here’s how the booster was designed to get back down to Earth. First, fall at a speed of about a mile a minute. Then fire boosters three times in sequence, which Space X describes in colorful terms. The first boost, called the “boostback burn” turns the bottom of the first stage downward, then the “supersonic retro propulsion burn” cuts the fall speed to about 800 feet per second. Then comes the “landing burn,” when the landing gear legs also push out for the set-down. By then the booster descends at a speed of about seven feet per second. Falcon 9 boosters have gone through these phases successfully in two prior tests, SpaceX said. At the end, the rockets tipped sideways and crashed into the ocean, causing damage that made them unusable. But that was according to plan, SpaceX said. Setting down with its landing legs onto the platform would have preserved the booster for its possible reuse. Though it didn’t work out, SpaceX didn’t necessarily expect it to.  It had puts the odds of success of this first try at 50% – at best.",4211,Ben Brumfield,0.039,0.908,0.053,0.9109

But officers have taken a shine to Jamal Rutledge since they arrested him in September in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. He helped save the life of the officer who was booking him. Now, he’s their hero. Officer Franklin Foulks was filling out Rutledge’s paperwork, as they sat alone in a holding area, where a surveillance camera recorded them. Rutledge, in cuffs, fidgeted on his seat, and stared at the floor, then he turned around to look through the security fencing behind him. That’s when Foulks keeled over sideways off his stool. Rutledge turned around to find him on the floor grabbing his chest. The juvenile defendant yelled for help, Fort Lauderdale Police Department said in a statement Tuesday. He paced the processing cell and kicked the gate and quickly got other officers’ attention. The officers rushed in, started CPR, called paramedics and gave Foulks a jolt with the defibrillator. Rutledge was led to another room. The juvenile defendant’s quick thinking was key in saving Foulks’ life, doctors told the police department. In a press photo, the officers who helped save Foulks lined up in honor of their heroic deed. In the middle was Rutledge in a proud pose. Smiles spread across all their faces. Next week, the city commission will honor them all in a meeting.

The decision came after Charlottesville police told UVA “that their investigation has not revealed any substantive basis to confirm that the allegations raised in the Rolling Stone article occurred at Phi Kappa Psi,” the university said in a statement. “We welcome Phi Kappa Psi, and we look forward to working with all fraternities and sororities in enhancing and promoting a safe environment for all,” UVA President Teresa A. Sullivan said. In November, Rolling Stone published “A Rape on Campus” featuring a woman identified only as Jackie. In the article, Jackie said she was brutally raped by seven men at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house during a party her freshman year. The article sparked international outrage and put UVA in the spotlight on the issue of campus sexual assault. UVA shut down Greek social life on November 21, two days after the article was published. But there were problems with the reporting. Within days, critics began to question some of the story’s details, as well as Rolling Stone’s decision not to contact the alleged attackers. The Washington Post, CNN and other news outlets followed up, identifying a number of contradictions and discrepancies. For example, two of Jackie’s friends told CNN that numerous details of the alleged attack described in Rolling Stone were entirely different from what Jackie told them that night. And they said that, while it seemed clear that she had been traumatized, they saw no injuries consistent with an attack as vicious as the article describes. Rolling Stone apologized, acknowledging discrepancies and admitting that its writer had not contacted the man who allegedly orchestrated the attack on Jackie. The magazine also said the writer didn’t contact any of the men that Jackie claimed participated in the attack, for fear that they would retaliate against her. “We published the article with the firm belief that it was accurate,” the magazine said. “Given all of these reports, however, we have come to the conclusion that we were mistaken in honoring Jackie’s request to not contact the alleged assaulters to get their account.” The fraternity’s chapter president, Stephen Scipione, said there is still “an opportunity to move forward with important safety improvements.” “This has prompted us to take a closer look at ourselves and what role organizations like ours may play in this problem,” Scipione said in a statement. “It’s opened all of our eyes to the problem of sexual assault.” Last week, the university reinstated Greek social life and announced new rules fraternities must follow if they want to throw a party. Among them: No pre-mixed drinks. Security at the doors. And sober brothers at every event, guarding the stairs and with key access to each room.",2917,Holly Yan,0.127,0.781,0.091,-0.9719

Watchdog groups are asking the predominantly Sunni Muslim nation to reconsider its stance toward atheists after authorities arrested a student and sentenced him to three years in prison for Facebook posts that insulted Islam. Karim Ashraf Mohamed al-Banna was arrested with a group of people at a cafe in November, according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression. An Egyptian minor offenses court sentenced him on blasphemy charges Saturday in what Human Rights Watch called “part of a wider government push to combat atheism and other forms of dissent.” “Atheists are one of Egypt’s least-protected minorities, although the constitution ostensibly guarantees freedom of belief and expression,” said Sarah Leah Whitson, HRW’s Middle East and North Africa director. “Egyptian authorities need to be guided by the constitution and stop persecuting people for atheism.” While Article 64 of Egypt’s Constitution says freedom of belief is absolute, it also says freedom to practice religious rituals or establish houses of worship is exclusive to Judaism, Christianity, Islam, the Baha’i faith and other Abrahamic religions. According to French Press Agency reports cited by HRW, a researcher with the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights said a local newspaper identified al-Banna as an atheist, and al-Banna’s lawyer reported that the student’s own father testified that he was fostering extremist ideas. Among al-Banna’s posts are a split image of a severely scarred woman and a Quran with the caption, “It’s OK to burn a woman … but it’s NOT OK to burn a book. Something is wrong with your priorities.” Another post carries the caption, “A big reward to whoever represents Islam” and shows several caricatures of bearded men in similar dress pointing at each other, saying, “This person does not represent Islam.” A judge will hear al-Banna’s appeal on March 9, and his bail has been set at 1,000 Egyptian pounds ($140), his lawyer told the French Press Agency. HRW says that blasphemy cases generally stem from “personal or unrelated disputes,” and since the country’s 2011 uprising, authorities have increasingly investigated complaints. While most of the cases involve alleged insults to Islam, HRW says that at least two men have been imprisoned for insulting Christianity. Christians make up roughly 10% of Egypt’s population. Authorities have also been targeting atheists of late, according to HRW. Police in December shut down a Cairo cafe popular with suspected atheists, and District Administrative Chief Gamal Mohie told a news outlet that the shop was unlicensed and “popularly known as a place for Satan worship, rituals and dances,” HRW reported. Also last month, the Dar al-Ifta, which issues religious edicts in Egypt, released a survey claiming Egypt had 866 atheists, more than any other Middle Eastern country. Two aides to the grand mufti, who heads Dar al-Ifta and is the country’s top official on religious laws, told a newspaper that the increase in atheism “should ring alarm bells.” This follows a March promise from a top Alexandria security official to arrest atheists and a June announcement by “Egypt’s youth and religious endowments ministries” that they would confront atheism.",3345,Eliott C.

Ohio State sophomore tailback Ezekiel Elliott continued his record-setting running with 246 yards and four touchdowns as the Buckeyes rolled to a 42-20 victory over Oregon in the inaugural College Football Playoff national championship on Monday. It was the third consecutive game in which Elliott ran for more than 200 yards. After a record 220 in the Big Ten championship in December and a record 230 in the Sugar Bowl on New Year’s Day, he set a mark for the national title contest (including the BCS title games) by making Oregon use multiple players to bring him down. And even that didn’t always work. At a school that produced the only two-time Heisman Trophy winner – Archie Griffin – and many other star running backs like Keith Byars and Eddie George, only Elliott has rushed for 200+ yards in back-to-back-to-back games. “We knew (coming into the game) that our O-line was bigger and more physical than their D-line, and we just had to punch them in the mouth,” he said, referring to his blockers. “The line came out and played their butts off. They paved the way for me.” Oregon vs. Ohio State: Score, Reaction from 2015 College Football Championship He told CNN’s Rachel Nichols all he had to do was to run through the holes his line opened and break a couple of tackles. “I give all the credit to my boys,” he said. “I knew that we were going to be unstoppable.” Oregon head coach Mark Helfrich gave Elliott credit but also pointed to the big guys who blocked for him. “He is an exceptional player as is their offensive line,” Helfrich told reporters. “A lot of credit to (all) those guys.” Ohio State head coach Urban Meyer, who became the second coach to win national titles at multiple schools, said Elliott is the most underrated running back in the country. “He’s one of the best post-contact yard guys I have ever been around,” he said. The quarterback duel between Heisman Trophy winner Marcus Mariota of Oregon and Cardale Jones, who only became Ohio State’s starter in their 13th game of the season due to an injury, was a bit of a stalemate. Mariota had more passing yards (333) and two TD passes to one for Jones, but the Ohio State quarterback also helped steady his team, particularly in the first half, with some key runs. His receivers struggled to get open early but the young Buckeyes’ offensive line eventually overpowered their Ducks’ defensive counterparts as the game wore on and Oregon wore down. That meant open holes for Elliott to exploit and time for Jones to throw. Ohio State (14-1) overcame four turnovers, including two mistakes that led to 10 points in the second half as Oregon (13-2) closed an 11-point halftime deficit to just one. But Oregon couldn’t stop Elliott, who carried the ball 36 times. Meyer said he would never have imagined after spring practice that his team would have been in the national title game. “But I didn’t quite understand the improvement these guys could make,” he said, also thinking back to early in the season when Ohio State was embarrassed by a home loss to a Virginia Tech team that ended up in the Military Bowl. Mariota, who would likely be a top pick in the NFL Draft should he choose to leave school early, said he was going to take a “couple of days” to make a decision on whether to stay. “Obviously (losing) hurts, (and) I’m sure it’ll weigh in a little bit but there’s a lot of other things that have to play into that decision,” he said. “There’s a lot of other things that could bring me back and not just this loss.” LeBron James Celebrates Ohio State Victory, Hugs Cardale Jones After Game",3723,Steve Almasy,0.062,0.859,0.079,0.8944

Fighting back tears, Rob Konrad, 38, recounted an incredible story Monday at a press conference in Plantation, Florida. He said he swam through cold water in the Atlantic Ocean for about 16 hours, alternating between the breast stroke and backstroke. Jellyfish stung him, and he was once circled by a shark, he said. Appearing healthy, his wife sitting next to him, Konrad told reporters that, treading water in the moments after falling off his boat Wednesday off the South Florida coast, he knew how improbable his survival was. He had read about what happens to the body under such circumstances. He figured that he had maybe three hours before hypothermia set in. It might take him more than 10 hours, at best, to get to shore. But he told himself he would make it. “I’ve got two beautiful daughters,” he said, his eyes watering. “I was hitting shore.” Konrad said he departed alone in his 36-foot Grady White boat from Deerfield Beach, Florida, at about 10:30 a.m. Wednesday and went about nine miles offshore. He set the boat on autopilot for 5 mph and started to fish. He said he hooked a fish around 1 p.m. and while trying to reel it in, a huge wave smashed into the boat and he lost his footing and fell overboard. The boat was moving east, he said, toward the Bahamas. He wasn’t wearing a flotation device and didn’t see any other boats around. “I quickly realized I was in a real bad situation,” he recounted. “I made a decision that I was going to start swimming toward shore, west.” Over the next 16 hours, he said he had two opportunities to be rescued. He saw a recreational fishing vessel. He was floating about 50 yards from it and tried to swim closer, but no one spotted or heard him. A little later, a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter circled and shined its light on him, he recounted. “They had come right over the top of me,” he said. But the helicopter flew away. “That was a difficult time. I realized at that point in time … I was on my own.” Coast Guard Lt. Cmdr. Gabe Somma told CNN on Monday that Palm Beach authorities contacted the Coast Guard to report that Konrad was missing and that it had a helicopter out looking for the former fullback. Down to his underwear, Konrad alternated between breast stroke and backstroke, mustering the strength to keep swimming. He made it through the night, and managed to coach himself to remain calm despite seeing “glowing” creatures in the water. When he heard waves crashing against the shore, he told himself: “At that point, you can’t not make it?” At around 4:30 a.m. Thursday, Konrad said he hit the shore in Palm Beach. He was shivering uncontrollably so he curled into a ball and tried to warm himself up. He had trouble walking but eventually made his way to a home where a security guard was working. The guard notified that Palm Beach Police Department, according to a department report. Konrad was taken to the hospital, where he said he was treated for hypothermia, severe dehydration and rhabdomyolysis, the breakdown of muscle tissue. Konrad’s remarkable experience has wowed distance swimmers. Sid Cassidy, a nationally renowned distance swimmer, has swum the 22-mile course around Atlantic City, New Jersey, five times. He’s trained in the same waters in South Florida where Konrad fought against the odds. “If you’re a good swimmer and you’re faced with an emergency, you could be capable of doing what he did,” Cassidy said. The Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission said it is investigating the boat incident. Depending on Konrad’s location in the Gulf Stream, he would have had to swim west, across the water’s south-to-north current, according to CNN meteorologist Chad Myers. The current could have been up to 4 mph. Normally swimming a mile in the ocean could take 20 to 30 minutes – if a person is very fit, Cassidy said. Most professional swimmers don’t attempt that many miles without help from a team providing hydration and nutrition. Konrad is the CEO of Alterna Financial, a South Florida financial services company. A fullback, he played at Syracuse University and was drafted by the Dolphins in the second round of the 1999 NFL Draft. He played his entire pro career for the Dolphins – 82 games, according to Pro-Football-Reference.com. He was released from his contract in 2005. “I can’t imagine that swimming isn’t part of his typical workout,” Cassidy said. Konrad said he judged which direction to swim by looking at the sun during the day and the stars at night. But even if Konrad knew which direction to start swimming, he’d have to contend with constant saltwater in his eyes, intense muscle fatigue, wind and, of course, current, noted Bruce Wigo, president and CEO of the International Swimming Hall of Fame in Fort Lauderdale. “From the salt alone, you’d have a tongue the size of a baseball,” said Wigo. It makes sense that Konrad stripped down in the water to lessen the drag, Wigo added. A former pro athlete like Konrad knows what it takes to push past pain, Cassidy surmised. He would know how to focus and to stay calm, too. Sitting next to her husband Monday, Tammy Konrad said he has always been the kind of guy who never gives up. “Rob is a very powerful human being,” she said. “He set his mind on something and he does go after it.” Diana Nyad: Rob Konrad’s amazing swim for survival",5471,Ashley Fantz,0.059,0.864,0.077,0.9734

Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez were ordered to appear at a preliminary hearing, the date of which has not yet been set, said District Attorney Kari Brandenburg of New Mexico’s Second Judicial Circuit. Sandy and Perez are accused of killing James Boyd in March. The 38-year-old homeless man spent the night before his shooting in a shelter, but when the shelter closed for the winter, Boyd tried to camp in the hills above the city, officials said. Overnight camping in the hills is illegal. Helmet and body cameras worn by dozens of city police who converged on the campsite showed Boyd with two small camping knives in his hands. Over several hours, Boyd talked with officers, at one point claiming to be “the Department of Defense.” The cameras captured officers converging on a small nest of rocks on the hillside. At one point, Boyd turned his back to the officers and they began firing. Officers fired a shotgun and nonlethal beanbag pellets at Boyd, while other officers were caught on camera throwing flash-bang grenades. The video also shows one officer unleashing his K-9 German shepherd against Boyd. The helmet cameras show Boyd wheezing for breath after the attack. He died later at a local hospital. Do police videos tell the whole truth? Sandy retired from the department in December of 2014, an Albuquerque police spokesman said. It’s unclear if Perez is still on the force. Local activists have demonstrated for months, protesting not only the Boyd shooting, but other shootings by city police officers since 2010. Records show that 26 civilians have been shot, a dozen of them fatally, by city police since 2010. Before Monday, no officer had been charged in connection with any shootings. The Justice Department in April 2014 found that “there is reason to believe” the city’s Police Department had a “pattern and practice” of excessive force. The city has since agreed to a memorandum of understanding allowing the Department of Justice to monitor the department.",2168,David Fitzpatrick,0.124,0.839,0.037,-0.9879

Harold Diamond, a 39-year veteran of Monticello School District took the cash option on the $326 million jackpot, which will total $130,676,438 after taxes, according to the New York Lottery statement. Diamond purchased the life-changing ticket after voting on Election Day in November. As it became clear he and his wife, Carol, won’t make it to dinner because of stormy weather, she insisted they stop and eat at the Valero and wait for the weather to clear.  “I have to thank her with both barrels, because if it weren’t for her insistence, we would not be here today,” he said in the release. While eating at the Subway shop within the Valero, Diamond noticed the Mega Millions jackpot flashing on the Lottery terminal and decided to get ten $1 Quick Pick numbers for that evening’s drawings. Diamond said he forgot about the ticket and remembered only when he heard people talk about it while playing golf, according to the New York Lottery news release. “I put the ticket in my wallet and forgot about it,” he said. “I went to play golf the next day and the guys in the clubhouse were talking about the jackpot-winning ticket someone bought at a Valero on Route 302, and I thought, wait a minute – I bought a ticket there last night! As soon as Diamond realized he was holding a lottery ticket from the shop, he rushed home to catch the evening news and saw that six numbers drawn matched the second set of Quick Pick numbers on his ticket, he said. “When I saw the last number, I yelled up to my wife I think we won a few bucks,” he laughed, at the check awarding ceremony. Diamond said they proceeded to read the numbers back and forth to each other. “We were like in a daze, in a dither,” he said. Diamond’s win marks the 29th time a New Yorker has won the top prize on the multistate megajackpot game, which launched in 2002. “We couldn’t be more thrilled. They were just a gem of a couple,” said Carolyn Hapeman, spokeswoman for the New York Gaming Commission. Lottery ticket misprint leaves man without $500K",2283,Julia Talanova,0.009,0.854,0.137,0.9943
82,82,01/12/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/11/us/nypd-law-enforcement-isis-threat/index.html,"NYPD, other law enforcement on alert after ISIS threat resurfaces",US,CNN,"The New York City Police Department  and other law enforcement personnel responded to a threat from ISIS after someone re-released a September 2014 message that tells followers to “rise up and kill intelligence officers, police officers, soldiers, and civilians.” The threat named the United States, France, Australia and Canada as targets. In an internal memo, NYPD employees were told to “remain alert and consider tactics at all times while on patrol,” especially in light of the attacks in France last week. The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a similar bulletin to law enforcement across the country. That bulletin and the NYPD memo make it clear that this new message is consistent with previous threats that ISIS and others, including al Qaeda, have issued. John Miller, the NYPD deputy commissioner for counterterrorism, tempered fears of a threat to officials in New York City. “I don’t think that we are under any more threat … or any less threat than we were the day before,” he said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” Miller said the department is on a “heightened security posture on a normal day compared to almost any other police department.” More than 1,000 police officers and civilian analysts are assigned to a counterterrorism mission every day, and officers have studied the recent attacks in France, he said. France was hit with three days of terror after three suspects killed 17 civilians in multiple attacks last week. Why is ISIS so successful at luring Westerners? On Sunday, an update to an old ISIS video was released by an unidentified person or organization, adding scenes from the France terror attack. The video was not issued by ISIS, and the warnings in the video are taken from an earlier video released on September 14. “They are hoping that the attacks in Paris by a group which included a self-professed ISIS follower will inspire other attacks in the West,” CNN terrorism analyst Paul Cruickshank said. Miller did say, however, that the video re-release shows that ISIS is “using the momentum from the Paris attacks in part of their messaging strategy to see: ‘Who can we get to follow this?’ ” ISIS spokesman Abu Mohammed al Adnani’s “fatwa calling for lone-wolf attacks back in September was a game changer,” Cruickshank said. “Since then, we’ve seen ISIS-inspired attacks in all the Western countries he specifically mentioned: Canada, the United States, Australia and France. In October we also saw United Kingdom police break up a plot to target soldiers and police by extremists who British authorities say were deeply influenced by Adnani’s fatwa,” Cruickshank added. NYPD: Hatchet attack an act of terror The spree began in Paris on Wednesday at the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical magazine, after two brothers stormed the building, killing 12 people and later escaping. Early Thursday, a female police officer was killed after a man dressed in all black and wearing bulletproof vests shot her in a Paris suburb. Two hostage situations unfolded Friday between law enforcement and the two sets of suspects. The first scene ended with the two brothers suspected of the magazine murders killed by security forces, said Bernard Corneille, the mayor of Othis, France. At the same time, authorities moved into a kosher store where hostages were being held by the alleged cop killer. While 15 hostages escaped, four were killed, as was the suspect.",3440,Lorenzo Ferrigno,0.17,0.776,0.054,-0.9977

The aircraft was being prepared for takeoff when flight attendants became aware oil from the aircraft’s auxiliary engine was used to paint the words “BYE BYE” in 6-inch-high letters above two faces, “one smiling and the other with a more troubling devilish expression,” according to a federal complaint filed Wednesday with the Department of Labor. The flight attendants say that on July 14, United Airlines ignored a “serious and credible threat to the security and safety of passengers by ordering them to fly in order to avoid cost and disruption to the airline’s flight schedule and revenue,” said David Marshall, the attorney representing the group. Also in the federal complaint, the flight attendants allege they informed the airline they were “uncomfortable flying unless United took steps to address this security threat, including deplaning 300-plus passengers and conducting a thorough security inspection of the aircraft.” Marshall said they wanted to “ensure that no explosive device had been planted in the plane.” United tells CNN the incident was investigated by its flight operations and safety teams. “There was no credible security threat,” the airline said in a statement. “All of FAA’s and United’s own safety procedures were followed, including a comprehensive safety sweep prior to boarding, and the pilots, mechanics and safety leaders deemed the aircraft entirely safe to fly.” The airline said the pilots were willing to fly the plane. The flight attendants said in the “wake of the disappearance of Malaysia Flight 370 and a warning issued by TSA about consumer electronic device bombs just a week earlier,” they had a “heightened duty and legal responsibility” to do whatever was necessary  to make sure everyone onboard was safe. Grace Lam, one of the terminated flight attendants said, “given the gravity of the risks involved – the lives of passengers and crew alike – we were not willing to bow to United’s pressure to ignore an unresolved security threat.” The flight attendants were fired in October for insubordination. The federal complaint accuses United of bullying and retaliatory firings. The flight attendants want their jobs back, back pay and compensatory damages.",2463,Rene Marsh,0.137,0.737,0.126,-0.7063
84,84,01/10/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/09/us/selma-civil-rights-matriarch/index.html,Watching ‘Selma’ with 103-year-old matriarch of the movement,US,CNN,"She was left for dead at the foot of Selma’s Edmund Pettus Bridge after the county sheriff declared: “Let the buzzards eat them.” A photograph immortalized the moment – a black, middle-aged woman beaten unconscious by white state troopers in a 1965 civil rights march that became known as Bloody Sunday. Now, on this day in December, 103-year-old Amelia Boynton Robinson is hosting a private screening of a new movie in which her role as a civil rights matriarch immortalizes her again. She was too frail to travel to Los Angeles for a special advance showing of “Selma” that was attended by other giants of the movement. So Paramount Pictures decided to bring the movie to her, to her home near Tuskegee University where she has lived for almost 40 years. She’s invited about 25 family and friends to watch with her on this winter day. I feel privileged to be among the camaraderie as the afternoon gathering gets underway with chicken wings, potato salad, fried fish, corn on the cob and sodas. Boynton Robinson wears a sky blue dress with a chunky gold chain and matching earrings. It’s a special occasion after all – a tribute to her and all that she has given. She rolls into the living room in a wheelchair. She looks feeble, and it’s difficult for her at times to articulate and project her words. But in spirit, she is the same as she has been her entire life: strong in her convictions. Her memories, too, are intact. “Are you excited?” one of her caregivers asks. Boynton Robinson lets a smile slip. “Yes, I am looking forward to it,” she replies. “Very much.” Everyone settles down on diagonal rows of metal folding chairs. The lights are dimmed and the logo for Paramount Pictures fills the television screen. Boynton Robinson sits in front, bundled in a woolen wrap and flanked by her son, Bruce, and Alabama State Sen. Hank Sanders. He is one of several people in the room who marched on Bloody Sunday. Every time a scene depicting brutality airs, like the Birmingham church bombing that killed four girls, people gasp. When Lorraine Toussaint – the actress of “Orange Is the New Black” fame who plays Boynton Robinson – appears on screen, people clap. “Amelia! Amelia!” they chant. Boynton Robinson watches intently. She shows little emotion, though others around her are reaching for tissues. Bloody Sunday When I arrived at Boynton Robinson’s home earlier in the day, she lay propped up on a hospital bed, a space heater blasting warm air into her bedroom. Pink foam curlers hugged her hair, still not completely gray. “Come closer,” she said. “I can’t see too good anymore.” She kissed my cheek and I settled at her bedside, my right hand clasped in her left. I thought back to the first time I laid eyes on the Bloody Sunday photo of Boynton Robinson. I was a college student then. Learning about her voting rights work made a lasting impression. I asked her to hurtle back in time and tell me about those days in Selma. She spoke as though she were telling her life story to a granddaughter. She’d worked in Selma for years in the Department of Agriculture, where she met her husband, Samuel William Boynton. In the 1930s, the couple began fighting for voting rights in the poorest parts of Alabama. So, by the time the civil rights movement gained steam in the 1960s, the Boyntons were leading the efforts in Selma. They let the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee use their insurance office as headquarters and opened up their Lapsley Street home for planning sessions and to provide shelter for fellow activists. What a lot of people don’t know is that in 1964, Boynton Robinson ran as a Democratic congressional candidate in Alabama, making her the first African-American and the first woman ever to do so. Amazingly, she won 11% of the vote. More striking perhaps is that she ran before federal protection for black people at Southern polls was mandated with the landmark Voting Rights Act. Boynton Robinson recalled how she persuaded the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to focus on Selma in 1965. I listened intently, my eyes falling on the lines and wrinkles on her face, each like a river tinged with sorrow and joy all at once. “I was not afraid,” she told me as she recounted the start of the march on Bloody Sunday. Fearless even though she had seen black protesters beaten and jailed so many times, even though just a few days earlier, a white state trooper had followed 30-year-old Jimmy Lee Jackson into a restaurant and shot him dead. She’d always been amazed and encouraged by white people who joined civil rights demonstrations. They had so much to lose, whereas poor and disenfranchised black people had nothing to lose and everything to gain. Boynton Robinson said Selma officials knew of the plans for a 54-mile march from the city to the Alabama state capital in Montgomery to demand the right to register and vote. The night before, at a meeting at Brown Chapel AME Church, movement leaders spoke with ordinary folks, asking them to join the march regardless of cost, even if it meant their life. Boynton Robinson felt anxious. She asked if I’ve read her autobiography, “Bridge Across Jordan.” I have read excerpts. In it, she writes of that night and how she thought about other mothers who had given their lives for less. “At that moment, a heavy burden fell from my mind and I was ready to suffer if need be,” she writes. The next morning, she woke up early and cooked breakfast for 15 people staying at her house. Then, she set off for Brown Chapel AME, on the edge of Selma’s largest black housing project, to help out before the march. She went to the church that Sunday with anxiety but little did she know that she would be at the center of an event that would become an apogee of the civil rights movement. On her way there, she passed a line of well-wishers. One woman told her:  “Honey, I can’t walk but I sure will pray for you all.” Said another: “Thank God he done sent his disciples to help us.” And still another: “I prayed so hard for you all. It might be stormy but God will bring you through!” She kept the prayers close to her heart. And she kept a plastic rain cap a friend gave her for protection from dreary weather. Leading the march were Hosea Williams of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and John Lewis, a leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee who later became a congressman from Georgia. Boynton Robinson was third from the front as the 600 protesters made their way from the black section of town to where the Edmund Pettus Bridge spans the Alabama River. From there, the plan was to make their long trek down Highway 80 all the way to Montgomery. “Like the children of Israel leaving Egypt, we marched toward the Red Sea, and we were on our way, not knowing what was before us,” Boynton Robinson says in her book. But she sensed trouble as she approached the bridge. As she began her descent, she saw a wall of white state troopers, standing shoulder to shoulder. “Those men are standing so close together an ant would get mashed to death if it crawled between them. They are as lifeless as wooden soldiers,” she told a friend. Dallas County Sheriff Jim Clark, under orders from Alabama Gov. George Wallace, armed his men with guns, billy clubs, cattle prods, tear gas canisters and masks. Beyond the wall of deputies were more men on horses. Boynton Robinson knew she would need all the prayers that had been said that day. And more. When the marchers were told to stop, Hosea Williams asked if he could say something. “No, you may not,” came the order from a captain. “Charge on them, men.” The troopers charged the marchers with their weapons drawn. They used their clubs and sticks. Soon the haze of tear gas filled the air. “I wondered why they were beating them so. I couldn’t understand,” Boynton Robinson tells me. The troopers beat their way left and right, down the entire line of marchers, almost a mile long. Boynton Robinson could hear screams, moans and groans. The horses on the scene were the most humane, Boynton Robinson thought. At least, they stepped over fallen victims. She felt a blow to her arm as she gasped for air. Another blow knocked her unconscious. Her body fell limp. The rain cap from her friend covered her face and saved her from the worst of the toxic fumes. “Whatever happened after that, I was told,” she says. “I don’t know how long I stayed there. But somebody said, ‘she’s dead’ and one of the young boys tried to drag me off.” People called for an ambulance. “But Clark said, ‘I’m not sending for an ambulance. Let the buzzards eat them.’” ‘I’m gonna let it shine’ As the sun goes down, Boynton Robinson’s living room grows as dark as a movie theater. More than half the film has played when we finally come to the point in which we see Hosea Williams and John Lewis standing at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, confronted by police. Some people in the room played extras in the movie and recognize themselves. “Look, there’s me,” says one. Then, there is pin-drop silence. It is hard for me to watch a cinematic recreation of what happened that day. I cannot begin to imagine how it feels for Boynton Robinson. I cannot even ask her later. The question seems unnecessary. She has lived 50 years with those memories and the scars of that day. Boynton Robinson was eventually taken to a hospital. She was told the tear gas had permanently damaged her esophagus. For many months, she saw a specialist. Her voice became deeper, turning from lyric-soprano to mezzo-soprano. As horrific as the experience was, Boynton Robinson says she was buoyed by Bloody Sunday and everything that came after: a successful march to Montgomery and later that year in August, President Lyndon B. Johnson’s signing of the Voting Rights Act into law. She was there at the White House on that historic day with King. “I realized what it meant to sing and really feel, ‘Oh freedom, over me; and before I’ll be a slave, I’ll be buried in my grave, and go home to my Lord and be free,’” she writes in her book. More than two hours have gone by, and “Selma’s” ending credits roll to music of the movement. This little light of mine, I’m gonna let it shine Boynton Robinson mouths the lyrics. The entire room is singing out loud. Now, I, too, feel the need to reach for a tissue. After the lights go back on, I ask Boynton Robinson what she thinks of Lorraine Toussaint’s portrayal. “It was good,” she says. “The movie is fantastic.” Another century Boynton Robinson has attended numerous Bloody Sunday events and commemorative marches, though her health may prevent her from attending the 50th anniversary this March. Almost 20 years ago, her friend Leon Frazier, a former police chief, arranged for white law enforcement officers to come meet her at her house. Frazier tells me he could not let Boynton Robinson go to her death without her reconciling with people she associated with her brutalization. That day, she came out of her bedroom to face again a sea of police like she did on Bloody Sunday. Only this time, they had a conversation, a cordial one. Sheriff Jim Clark was not among the law enforcement officers who came to speak with her. But when he died in June 2007, Boynton attended his funeral. She wanted to prove to people that she held no malice in her heart, even though, she said at the time, Clark was “almost an inhuman man.” Even some segregationists had thought him evil. “He was supposed to have been so popular,” she tells me, “but there were only 80 people at his funeral.” She also went to his funeral to keep with her Christian faith, which has guided her through her life journey. Do good unto others, she believes. Forgive. “I was brought up by people who loved others,” she says. “I love people. We had no animosity. We had no feeling that we hate anyone.” And there was yet another factor. People are not born racists, she says. They are trained to become that way. That’s what happened to the white people she confronted in Alabama 50 years ago. She believes she has lived so long because God intended it that way. That she is not through talking to young people and setting them on the right track. Until a few years ago, she was still standing on her feet giving speeches. America, she says, has made great strides. She beams at the fact that a black man serves as her president and is considered the most powerful man on Earth. A framed photograph of Barack Obama hangs on her wall, as does a letter from him expressing warm wishes for her 103rd birthday. But this nation still has a long way to go in dealing with race, she says. She’s been keeping up with the news of the past few months – Michael Brown’s killing in Ferguson, Missouri. Eric Garner’s in New York. Tamir Rice’s in Cleveland. They take her back to a time she knew before, back to Jim Crow. She says a whole new generation has been stirred by these cases of police killings. She hopes young people will pick up the reins of a struggle her generation launched. All her life, she has been extremely proud of her roots, a mixture of African slaves, Cherokee Indians and Europeans. But if you ask her about her race, she is apt to answer like this: “I am a member of the human race.” She wants, more than anything, for Amerians to see each other not for the color of their skin but for the people who they are. Maybe, she tells me, it will take another 100 years before that happens. She will turn 104 in August. She knows she will not be around to see the day she describes and hopes America’s black youth will sign up for a long haul. That there will be many more pivotal moments in black history. Many more Selmas. Because, she says, pulling me close: “You can never know where you are going unless you know where you have been.”",13752,Moni Basu,0.08,0.834,0.086,0.9386

One senior official told CNN: “We’ve expected this.” The official says the attacks demonstrate how “the boundaries between all of these affiliates is seemingly breaking down and the threat is metastasizing and turning into a global network.” Both of the Kouachi brothers are believed to have traveled to Yemen, with at least one said to have trained with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. The third suspect, Amedy Coulibaly, told a French television station before he was killed that he associated with ISIS, though investigators have not corroborated that claim. U.S. officials say the sophistication, coordination and apparent level of training exhibited by the Paris suspects shows how we are moving from a world of mega terror in the 9/11 era to decentralized autonomous, smaller scale and harder-to-detect operations. The concern was reflected in Friday’s FBI and Department of Homeland Security notice sent to law enforcement agencies across the country, highlighting the tactics and techniques used by the suspects – indicating some kind of formal training. Even more troubling to U.S. officials is that nations will likely see more of the same. That sentiment was echoed this week by the head of Britain’s MI5, who warned more terrorist attacks are to come. “This is in perpetuity what we’re dealing with. It’s like the war on drugs.

During the video hearing, Pinellas-Pasco Circuit Judge Michael Andrews asked the handcuffed Jonchuk if he was able to hire his own lawyer. “No,” Jonchuk replied. Would he like one appointed? Again, the reply was, “No.” “Are you sure?” Andrews pressed. “I want to leave it in the hands of God,” Jonchuk said. Asked if that meant he wanted to represent himself, Jonchuk repeated his answer, to which the judge said, “Pretty sure God’s not going to be representing you in this case. You’re going to be standing trial. Would you like someone standing next to you as you’re standing trial?” “Yes, that is pure and good, not evil,” the defendant said. “I’m going to do the best I can to give you a pure and good lawyer,” Andrews said. “I don’t want a court-appointed lawyer,” Jonchuk said, seeming slightly perturbed. “I want to leave it in the hands of God.” Andrews instructed an officer to bring Jonchuk back to his courtroom Monday “to see if he wants an attorney.” Though he ordered Jonchuk held on bonds of $10,000 each for charges of aggravated assault on a law enforcement officer and aggravated fleeing and eluding, Andrews ruled there would be no bond on the first-degree murder charge. Jonchuk was arrested Thursday after a St. Petersburg police officer was driving home just after midnight and saw a car whiz past him, driving about 100 mph, authorities said. According to the arrest affidavit, Jonchuk parked on the Dick Misener Bridge, exited, ignored the officer’s command to stay in the vehicle and reached into the right rear passenger seat where his daughter, Phoebe, was sitting. Jonchuk “then carried the child in his arms to the side of the bridge and intentionally dropped the child into the water … then entered his vehicle and fled the scene,” the affidavit said. The officer heard a splash and tried to climb beneath the bridge to save the girl, but the current was too strong, St. Petersburg police spokeswoman Yolanda Fernandez told CNN affiliate WFLA. It’s about a 62-foot drop to the water from that point on the bridge. Another officer tried to pull over Jonchuk’s white Chrysler PT Cruiser on Interstate 275, but the defendant allegedly “conducted a U-turn and drove directly at a backup officer’s vehicle, in which case the officer had to take evasive action to avoid a crash,” another arrest affidavit said. Several law enforcement agencies joined the chase, including marked patrol cars with their emergency lights and sirens activated, for several miles.

87,87,01/09/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/08/us/nfl-mueller-ray-rice-video/index.html,"Mueller: No evidence NFL saw Rice video, but should have probed",US,CNN,"There is no evidence that anyone at the NFL saw or possessed a video showing Ray Rice punching his then-fiancée until it was made public, but the league should have known it needed to dig deeper into the incident, an external investigative report released Thursday concludes. The report wraps up an inquiry by former FBI Director Robert Mueller into how the NFL initially investigated the then-Baltimore Ravens running back’s attack on Janay Palmer last February at the Revel Casino Hotel in Atlantic City. “We concluded there was substantial information about the incident – even without the in-elevator video – indicating the need for a more thorough investigation,” Mueller said in his report. “The NFL should have done more with the information it had, and should have taken additional steps to obtain all available information about the February 15 incident.” The NFL asked for Mueller’s report in September after a public outcry over NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell’s handling of Rice’s discipline. “While this investigation has now concluded, our focus on the underlying issues and our commitment to positive change remain as strong as ever,” Goodell said in a written statement. “We have all learned a great deal in the past months and expect to be judged by how we lead going forward on issues of domestic violence and sexual assault.” Here are some things we learned through the report: No evidence of video at NFL office In September, The Associated Press reported that a law enforcement official told one of its reporters that the source mailed a copy of a video from a surveillance camera inside an elevator at the now closed Revel casino showing Rice knocking out Palmer to a league executive in April. The report said a woman called from a league phone number to acknowledge receipt of the video. The report says more than 200 league employees were interviewed and found no evidence that happened. Among the employees questioned were the women whose ID badges indicated they were in the NFL office on April 9. All 188 said they made no phone call. “Each denied having seen the in-elevator video or even hearing a rumor that an in-elevator video of the Rice incident had been received by the league before it appeared on (celebrity news website) TMZ on September 8,” investigators said. Also questioned were people in the mailroom, and no one there could remember a package sent to Jeff Miller, the league’s senior vice president of security. Multiple emails from high-level NFL executives indicate they had not seen the video before it was posted on TMZ, the report says. Ray Rice’s attorney had copy of video on April 1 The prosecutor’s office in Atlantic County wanted to wait until after a grand jury heard the case in late March before releasing the video to Michael Diamondstein, Rice’s attorney. Diamondstein had asked for a copy from the casino on February 20. He was told by the casino’s lawyer that police said not to turn over any evidence while an investigation was ongoing. Later Diamondstein was referred to the prosecutor. Rice was indicted on March 27 on a third-degree aggravated assault charge. His lawyer received a copy of the video from the casino on April 1 and from the prosecutor days later as part of the process of discovery. The report says Diamondstein chatted about the video with Ravens President Richard Cass and the lawyer said it was “terrible.” The two disagree precisely when the call took place and how much of what was on the video was discussed. Diamondstein told investigators that if the league had asked for a copy of the video, he would have provided it. That was one of the league’s missteps identified in the report. Others included not contacting police officers who investigated the incident, not attempting to get videos from the casino or the prosecutors, and not following up with the Ravens to see if the team had information the league did not. “Had the league undertaken a more substantial investigation, it may have gathered available information about the incident, possibly including the in-elevator video prior to its public release,” the report says. Atlantic City Police called NFL in March A private investigator who was working the case for the NFL had been in touch with the Atlantic City Police Department trying to get the arrest report and other documents. He was told twice the police wouldn’t provide the information. He asked a supervisor in the records division, Ava Davenport, if he could get reports if he filed an Open Public Records Act request. She said everything in it would be redacted. On March 28, the day after Rice’s indictment, someone using Davenport’s work phone called the NFL office and spoke to an operator for 59 seconds. Police declined to discuss the nature of the call and the operator couldn’t remember what was discussed. The call wasn’t transferred, records showed. The incident was viewed live A security officer at the casino watched Rice strike Palmer twice as it happened on a surveillance monitor. That employee called another security officer to the elevator. When a supervisor arrived Palmer couldn’t remember what had happened. Two DVD copies of surveillance video were given to police that morning. The in-house copy of video was viewable by security workers for several days before access was restricted. One employee told Mueller’s team as many as 40 people had access to the room where the video could be watched. Mueller calls investigation independent Several media reports had called into question Mueller as lead investigator because his law firm has done work for the NFL. But Mueller writes he has never provided legal services to the league nor has any of his team. Mueller said he joined the WilmerHale firm in March 2014, years after the firm helped the league negotiate with two media groups. In the past four years, the firm has only provided advice on immigration issues. “Placing these relationships in context, I am quite confident that the ties described above have in no way influenced the conduct of this investigation,” he says. Recommendations Mueller says: “Our findings demonstrate the weaknesses inherent in the league’s longstanding practice of deferring to the criminal justice system with respect to the investigation of facts and the imposition of discipline under the Personal Conduct Policy. Discipline should be imposed on the basis of the specific nature of the player’s conduct, not solely or necessarily on the disposition of a criminal case.” He recommend the NFL establish an investigative team for domestic violence and sexual assault cases, that the league expand its security department with a special counsel and other personnel, and clarify policies that assured teams the league shared information. “Investigations of domestic violence cases present unique challenges,” the report says.",6844,Jill Martin,0.074,0.867,0.059,-0.9503
88,88,01/09/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2014/11/26/us/national-ferguson-demonstrations/index.html,Protesters flood streets across U.S. as Ferguson dismay spreads coast to coast,US,CNN,"The sparks of outrage that started in Ferguson, Missouri, have ignited a firestorm of protests across the country. But the national furor isn’t just about one grand jury’s decision on one shooting case. To many protesters, the death of unarmed black teenager Michael Brown – and the lack of an indictment for the officer who shot him – are symbolic of racial injustice in America. “I think that it’s important for people to know that the decision not to indict (Officer) Darren Wilson means that the system does not value black lives,” one protester marching through Los Angeles told CNN. Complete coverage of what’s happening in Ferguson “I think that it means that a cop can kill a black or brown kid when he’s defenseless and unarmed and not get charged. I think that it means that we either fight back and stand up and end police terrorism.” More than 170 protests sprouted up across the country Tuesday. Some crowds blocked bridges, tunnels and major highways. But unlike the violence that erupted in Ferguson on Monday night, most of the demonstrations were peaceful. In New York, a protesters spanning an array of races and ages filled Times Square with their hands up, some chanting, “Don’t shoot.” In Washington, a crowd including prep school students lay silently on a sidewalk, as if dead. And in Boston, even jail inmates joined in the protest silently from a window. Here’s what the country looked like late Tuesday: ATLANTA The Public Enemy anthem pumping from mounted speakers at a protest in downtown Atlanta captured the mood of the crowd of roughly 300 Tuesday night. “Fight the Power,” the rapper’s voice shouted over the speaker. “Fight the powers that be. …” Some Atlanta protesters held signs that read “Enough” and “We are all one bullet away from being a hashtag.” “It’s a travesty; it’s just not right,” ShaCzar Brown said, holding up a sign that read, “Stop killer cops.” “Seventy years ago, it was legal to kill black people,” Brown said, referring to the spate of lynchings that spread through the U.S. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. “It’s essentially still legal.” BOSTON About 1,000 protestors marched through the streets of Boston, passing by the South Bay House of Correction where inmates looked on from windows – many of them holding their hands up in the air. On one window, someone had written “Mike Brown” in tape. Even though police said 15 people were arrested, the gathering was peaceful. “I’m very proud of the young people here,” Police Superintendent in Chief William Gross told the Boston Globe. “Do you see any cars burning? Do you see any broken windows? No.” Protester Daniel Jose Older told CNN the demonstration rapidly grew from a small gathering to hundreds of people. “Folks have taken over the streets,” Older said. “It’s a beautiful thing to see.” CHICAGO About 200 members of the Black Youth Project 100 started a 28-hour sit-in outside Mayor Rahm Emanuel’s office on Tuesday morning. Why 28 hours? According to the group, a black person is killed by a police officer or a person protected by the state every 28 hours in America. Some lay motionless on the City Hall floor, as if they had been shot. But by Tuesday night, the protest was over. After City Hall closed for the day, police threatened to arrest those attempting to stay inside. LOS ANGELES A stretch of the 101 Freeway in Los Angeles was temporarily shut down in both directions after protesters took road blocks from the streets and put them on the freeway, police said. But protesters who gathered outside Los Angeles police headquarters demonstrated peacefully.  “We have detained people. We don’t have any property damage to speak of,” Officer Jack Richter said. “We are letting (the people) exercise their constitutional rights.” MINNEAPOLIS A woman in a group of protesters blocking an intersection was run over by a car. The Star Tribune newspaper reported that the driver honked at the protesters before knocking a few people onto the hood of the car and apparently running over the woman’s legs. The woman was hospitalized with “minor injuries.” NEW YORK A massive protest wound its way from Union Square to FDR Drive and to the United Nations, Times Square and Harlem. “Now it’s not clear where we’re going,” said CNN’s Miguel Marquez, who was interviewing protesters as they continued marching after midnight. One demonstrator said he didn’t even know about the protest until he saw it pass by his workplace on Times Square. He decided to join in. “I just want to help bring about change … sometimes I am profiled based on my race,” said the protester, who is black. “I think this is progress … now we’re going to make sure things are going to change.” As they marched, some protesters chanted, “Mike Brown! Mike Brown!” Police, who were nearby in large numbers, stayed back and let the marchers go. OAKLAND Perhaps the most turmoil Tuesday night was in Oakland, California, where vandals smashed the windows of a car dealership and looted several businesses, including a T-Mobile cell phone store. Some also set bonfires in the city. One row of bonfires stretched across a road, blocking off access. At least one person was seen adding more items to the fires. WASHINGTON DC In Washington, protesters lay down on a sidewalk outside police headquarters as if dead, Nikki Burdine of CNN affiliate WUSA tweeted.

The state will stop using the two-drug regimen of midazolam and hydromorphone, the department said in a press release. The drug combination was last used in January 2014 on convicted murderer Dennis McGuire. Witnesses said he convulsed and gasped about 10 minutes before he died. The McGuire execution was closely watched because midazolam, a sedative, and hydromorphone, a painkiller, had never been used in a U.S. execution. Ohio, like many states, was forced to find new execution drugs after European-based manufacturers banned U.S. prisons from using their drugs in executions – among them, Danish-based Lundbeck, which manufactures pentobarbital. Ohio will add thiopental sodium, a drug the state used for lethal injections from 1999-2011, the department said. Thiopental sodium and pentobarbital will be the only drugs used. JoEllen Smith, spokesman for the corrections department, confirmed that Ohio has 40 vials of midazolam set to expire April 1. The release said the the February 11 execution of Ronald Phillips, and possibly others, will be postponed while Ohio secures a supply of pentobarbital and thiopental sodium.

Sgt. Rich Weiner said the man tried to buy a ticket with a woman’s identification at Port Columbus International Airport, then with his own ID, but was refused. The man, who was in his early 40s and lived in the Columbus area, returned to his car, where one officer was investigating a suspicious vehicle call. The man and the officer were talking, police said, when the suspect pulled a knife and tried to attack the officer, who opened fire. It is unclear whether the man was struck by any of the shots from the officer, but he fell, then stood up. As he made his way toward the terminal, backup officers approached. The man, who still had a knife in his hand, was shot by one of those officers. Weiner only said that multiple shots were fired. He didn’t disclose how many times the man was struck. The suspect had other knives hidden in his clothes, Weiner said. “It’s too early to talk about terrorism,” Weiner said when asked by reporters about possible motives. “At this point, this is just a violent encounter between an armed man and the officers here.” Police refused to say at what airline counter the man had tried to purchase a ticket and where he intended to fly. The names of the man who was killed and the police officer who shot him were not immediately released. A bomb squad examined the car and objects on the man that raised alarm, Weiner said.

91,91,01/08/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/06/us/us-new-planets-1/index.html,Eight new planets might be capable of hosting life,US,CNN,"If you’re planning on packing up and changing addresses to Kepler-442b or Kepler-438b anytime soon, you can probably put away the moving boxes for now. While the newly discovered exoplanets and their six friends hold the exciting possibility of being capable of supporting life, scientists won’t know for sure for a while. The Kepler Space Telescope made the discoveries, pushing the number of such exoplanets it has found to more than 1,000. The punch list, according to astronomers with the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA), sounds good. They are not too close or too far from their star so that they might have water instead of ice or steam. They are about the right size, and they get a decent amount of sunlight. And they also might have the kinds of surface that could bear life. “Most of these planets have a good chance of being rocky, like Earth,” lead author Guillermo Torres of the CfA said in a release. Which is a lot more hospitable that being a big ball of gasses. “We don’t know for sure whether any of the planets in our sample are truly habitable,” second author David Kipping of the CfA said in a release. “All we can say is that they’re promising candidates.” Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b are the most similar to Earth of any known exoplanets to date. And even if there was confirmation, Christine Pulliam with the CfA said teams are “still a couple of generations of telescope development away,” from even seeing them, much less visiting. Kepler-438b is 470 light-years away and Kepler-442b is 1,100 light years away, according to CfA. “That’s a little far away,” Caldwell said, “We need to get to Mars first.” Still it’s very exciting just to discover them and to be closer to identifying a “second” Earth. At a panel held last summer at NASA headquarters in Washington, astronomers said they were “very close in terms of technology and science to actually finding the other Earth.” That’s due in part to the Kepler telescope. The planet-hunting Kepler probe, launched in 2009, finds planets by looking for dips in the brightness of a star as a planet transits, or crosses, in front of that star. Pulliam said the team of scientists monitored data for more than 160,000 stars, which led them to the eight new planets. The couple most like Earth, Kepler-438b and Kepler-442b, both orbit red dwarf stars, which are cooler and smaller than the Earth’s sun. Kepler-438b’s diameter is 12% bigger than Earth and has a 70% chance of being rocky, which means the surface of the planet appears to be like Earth’s. Kepler-442b is about one-third larger than Earth with a 60% chance of being rocky.  Scientists give it a 97% chance of being in the habitable zone, but caution that the estimates aren’t certain.

Boa constrictor slinks out of San Diego toilet,US,CNN,"It rose up from the sewer, but it was more eeeeek! than eeeew! It’s hard to explain how a 5-foot boa constrictor nosed its way up into a toilet through the down-pipe in a San Diego office building Wednesday. Apparently, no one was sitting on it at the time. When Stephanie Lacsa walked into the bathroom at her public relations company, she noticed that the toilet water level was higher than usual. So, she went at it with a plunger. It worked. Something brown appeared in the toilet. Bad enough, but then it kept on coming. “As soon I saw the flicker of its tongue, I definitely knew that it was in fact a large snake heading straight towards me,” she said. Aaaah! She ran out of the bathroom screaming and taped its door shut. Then animal control got the call to come out and take care of it.  It was a first for the officer. She’d never seen that before, Lacsa said. Her business partner Holly Wells blames it on the building’s fixtures. “Our building, which is the Old San Diego City Hall, was built in 1886, so we are accustomed to the old pipes and stubborn plumbing,” she said. Animal control is taking the boa to a veterinarian. Wells hopes it finds a good home with people who leave their toilet seats down.

93,93,01/08/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/07/us/uva-greek-life-reinstated/index.html,"University of Virginia reinstates Greek social life, but with new rules",US,CNN,"No more pre-mixed drinks. Security at the doors. And sober brothers at every event, guarding the stairs and with key access to each room. Those are some of the rules that fraternities will have to abide by if they want to throw a party, the University of Virginia says. UVA shut down Greek social life on November 21, two days after the publication of a now-discredited Rolling Stone magazine article about an alleged gang rape in a fraternity house on the Charlottesville campus. The article’s credibility aside, the university acknowledged this week that it needs to evaluate a broader problem, and said the Greek life “pause” was intended to allow leadership to work on improving safety at fraternity and sorority events. Reinstatement comes with a stipulation that each Greek organization agree by January 16 to new rules – devised by UVA’s Greek leadership councils – for university social events. Among them are requirements that at least three members of a fraternity be “sober and lucid” at each fraternity function, and at least one of the “sober brothers” have key access to every room in the fraternity house during the party, according to the document. Also, pre-mixed drinks or punches are prohibited from fraternity parties. Beer and wine must be opened and “poured visibly at the bar by a sober brother.”  And security officers must be hired to monitor the entrance at parties where there are fewer fraternity members than nonmembers. “I believe the new safety measures recommended by the student leaders in the Greek community will help provide a safer environment for their members and guests,” UVA President Teresa Sullivan said in a press release. Accusations and contradictions “A Rape On Campus,” the 9,000-word article by Sabrina Erdely in the November 19 issue of Rolling Stone, initially garnered widespread, mostly sympathetic media attention. In the article, a woman identified only as Jackie, claims that she was brutally raped by seven men at the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house, while two more gave encouragement, during a party on September 28, 2012, while she was a freshman. Within days, critics began to question some of the story’s details, as well as Rolling Stone’s decision not to contact the alleged attackers. The Washington Post, CNN and other news outlets followed up, identifying a number of contradictions and discrepancies. Two of Jackie’s friends told CNN that numerous details of the alleged attack as related by Rolling Stone were entirely different from what Jackie told them that night. And they said that, while it seemed clear that she had been traumatized, they saw no injuries consistent with an attack as vicious as the article describes. Nonetheless, one of the two friends said, he “didn’t have any doubts” that the version she told him at the time was true. Phi Kappa Psi said that the man Jackie claimed had lured her to a dark room was never a member. It also cited records showing it did not have a party on the night in question, and said its house doesn’t have a side staircase – important because Jackie described descending such a staircase as she left, bloodied and broken. “It’s not part of our culture. It’s just not true,” said the fraternity’s attorney, Ben Warthen. On December 5, the magazine published an editor’s note that said “we apologize to anyone who was affected by the story and we will continue to investigate the events of that evening” in late 2012 when the alleged attack occurred. The magazine admitted that Erdely had not contacted the man who Jackie claimed orchestrated the alleged attack, nor did she contact any of the men she said were participants, fearing that they would retaliate against her. In an article detailing the key contradictions, the Washington Post reported that it had interviewed Jackie and that she stood by her story. The Post article came out the same day as the Rolling Stone editor’s note. Police are continuing to investigate the allegations, and a state investigation of UVA’s treatment of sexual assault allegations is ongoing.

So when the New Mexico native went to a gas station to purchase his weekly Powerball ticket, on one particular Saturday in December, he sprung for a scratch-off ticket, too. “You only live once, right?” he said. The winning numbers printed at the top of the scratch-off were two and one. Wiles said he was in shock when he scratched off five of them, his winnings totaling more than $500,000.  The amount confused him, he said, because the maximum prize on the ticket is $250,000. Still, he said, he “thought [he] won big!” But when he took the ticket to the store where he bought it, the store clerk put the ticket in a scanner that said Wines wasn’t a winner after all. Wines called the New Mexico Lottery Commission, which confirmed the ticket was a misprint. Wines’ fun hobby had now become the cause of an emotional roller coaster. He reached out to the New Mexico Lottery Commission, hoping it might honor the ticket.  But it only thanked him for calling to attention the misprint and offered him $100 in lottery bucks. Wiles said it felt like a “brick to the head.” “That’s a far cry from $500,000, don’t you think?” he said.

95,95,01/07/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2014/07/03/us/hot-car-deaths/index.html,"After leaving a child in a car, ‘that pain…never goes away’",US,CNN,"Lyn Balfour promised her son, limp in her arms, that she would never let it happen to another parent. She vowed to her baby she would tell every mother, every father, everyone who has had the responsibility of caring for a child. That’s all she could do now. She would be the world’s horrific reminder that people can and do leave their children in hot cars. “The pain – it’s not like a normal death in your family where you lose a child … you get to grieve and move on,” Balfour said, her voice cracking. “That pain is every day. It’s always there. It never goes away.” Leaving a child in a car seems unfathomable to many. Isn’t a child a caregiver’s priority at all times? What kind of person just forgets? If you are quick to say, ‘I could never,’ consider that people who devote their lives to studying these incidents say that anyone of any age or profession is liable to do it. So are people who are educated and not, rich, poor or middle class, mothers as much as fathers. It happens more than one might think: about three to four times a month in the United States. Criminal charges can vary widely from case to case. On Thursday, a suburban Atlanta dad whose toddler died after he left him in a car for seven hours on a sweltering summer day will appear in court. Justin Ross Harris faces murder and second-degree child cruelty charges. It has been seven years since Balfour forgot her 9-month-old Bryce in her backseat while she spent hours at work.  That morning she was rushing to deal with an emergency at her Charlottesville, Virginia, job. Her routine was off. She normally dropped Bryce off at day care. But that day she had tucked the 9-month-old in a car seat directly behind her driver’s seat, rather than his usual spot behind the passenger seat. She parked, got out and went inside to work. About 4 p.m., the sitter called her to see how Bryce was doing. Balfour paused. She was confused. Wasn’t the baby with his sitter? “No, Lyn, you didn’t drop him off this morning,” the babysitter answered. Stunned, realizing what she’d done, Balfour ran to her car. She started CPR on Bryce. The mother’s cries for help would be heard on a 911 call later played in court, but it was too late. Overheated, Bryce died. How often does it happen? At least 44 children died in 2013 from heatstroke caused by being left in cars in the United States, according to national nonprofit organization KidsAndCars.org. At least 13 children have died this year for the same reason. Over the past decade, the group figures, there have been at least 388 children who have died of vehicular heatstroke. KidsAndCars bases its data on U.S. news reports, and when it’s possible, the group’s volunteers confirm the information independently with law enforcement, attorneys and families, director Amber Rollins said. Rollins said she’s unaware of any group that tracks the number of children worldwide who have died after being left inside vehicles. The group hears from parents who reach out after years of living in silent shame about the time they forgot their child in a car, she said. Balfour works with KidsAndCars now, and recounts her story on its website. During a recent interview with CNN’s Brooke Baldwin, Balfour recalled learning on the day of her son’s funeral that she would be prosecuted for his death. Charged with second-degree murder, Balfour could have gone to prison for 40 years, according to the Washington Post, which told her story and others involving caregivers who left their children in cars. A jury listened to the mother’s 911 call, her voice full of panic and horror. They found her not guilty. “I never made excuses for his death,” she said.  “It was my lapse in responsibility … why he’s not here.” Over the years, Balfour has gone over and over in her head how she could have done it. She is a person skilled at doing many things at once. She’s a former service member with one tour in Bosnia and two tours in Iraq and a professional who, she says, won a Bronze Star for managing tens of millions of dollars in projects. On KidsAndCars, Balfour wrote of that day: “I am in shock and overcome in disbelief that this cannot be happening to me, I cannot be the type of mother who would accidentally forget her child. …” Who would do such a thing? A mother is just as likely as a father to leave her child in a vehicle, the Post reported. The people who have done it range in age and financial and educational background, experts say. A veterinarian, a doctor, a dentist, a professor, a school principal and a rocket scientist are among the parents who have accidentally forgotten about their children and are now among KidsAndCars’ members. It doesn’t matter if a person is highly organized or often absentminded, though people with intense demands in their lives can have more stress and be more sleep-deprived – two factors that can increase the likelihood their minds could be sidetracked away from a baby in the backseat, said David Diamond, a psychology and molecular physiology professor at University of South Florida. He studies memory, and for a decade has focused his attention on a phenomena that’s come to be known as Forgotten Baby Syndrome. He, too, said he wasn’t aware of any international figures on how many children have died after being left in vehicles. Diamond wrote recently on HLNTV.com that Forgotten Baby Syndrome, is a “failure of prospective memory, which refers to the planning and execution of an action in the future.” Two brain structures process prospective memory: the hippocampus, which stores new information, and the prefrontal cortex, which enables planning, he wrote. The hippocampus processes that a child is in a car. The prefrontal cortex enables a person to create a route, factoring in a change in plans like going to day care rather than going directly to work. Forgotten Baby Syndrome seems to involve a “clash between prospective memory and another form of memory, referred to as habit memory,” he wrote. “Habit memory is formed subconsciously through repeated activities, such as learning how to ride a bike or, in the case of FBS, repeatedly driving to and from home and work.” Read Diamond’s Op-Ed about FBS Lately, Rollins has noticed a greater awareness of how diligent, loving caregivers forget their children in cars. More people who have gone through the experience seem willing to discuss it, she said. They’re opening up online, particularly in the comments section of news stories. “More people seem to be saying, ‘Hey, this happened to me, this can happen to wonderful parents,’” Rollins said. After the hot car death of the Georgia toddler in June, CNN legal analyst Sunny Hostin wrote about how she and her husband accidentally left their infant daughter in a hot car during a shopping trip. They realized the mistake minutes into a shopping trip, and ran to the car, she said in a CNN.com Opinion piece. “Walking into the garden center, my husband turned to me and said: ‘My God. We left Paloma in the car.’ I screamed, dropped my purse, ran to the car and opened the door. The car was already warm. Her face already flushed. But she was fine and still sleeping. I was ashamed, embarrassed and horrified at what I had done. “It dawned on me immediately – I could have killed my girl,” she wrote. Hostin’s daughter wasn’t hurt. Had Hostin never experienced what it was like to forget her own child, she would have said that all parents must be prosecuted for an act like that. “I punish myself all the time for leaving my girl in that car for a few minutes,” she wrote. Read Hostin’s story: ‘I, too, left my child in a hot car’ What charges have caregivers faced? When parents go to court after leaving their children in hot cars, the outcomes can vary greatly. Daniel Gray was recently sentenced to four years in prison for the death of his infant, who was left in a car for three hours during a hot Arizona summer, according to the Arizona Republic. Gray pleaded guilty to manslaughter. In April, authorities arrested Eric Fred Carlin in Florida for allegedly leaving his 9-month-old son in a hot car for 20 minutes. The baby survived, but Carlin was charged with child neglect without great bodily harm and unattended child in a motor vehicle in excess of 15 minutes, CNN affiliate WPTV said. In March, investigators charged Shanesha Taylor of Arizona with felony child abuse after she allegedly left her children in her vehicle while she went on a job interview. Recently, Taylor spoke publicly for the first time about what happened, giving details of her life to a New York Times reporter. Without childcare options, Taylor said she chose to leave her kids in her car so she could go to an interview for a job that she needed to pull herself out of poverty. Taylor parked in a Scottsdale lot. There was no shade, and it was 71 degrees, the newspaper reported. Attributing to a police report, the Times said Taylor left her sons in their car seats, cracked her car’s tinted windows and left the keys in the ignition with the fan on but the engine off. In 10 minutes, a car can heat up 20 degrees Fahrenheit, and cracking a window does little to keep a car cool; a child’s body temperature can rise up to five times faster than an adult’s, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Many who felt passionately about Taylor’s case spoke out on social media. While some viewed her as a criminal who should be prosecuted, others saw her as a desperate single mother and a symbol of Americans suffering in a terrible economy. She is out of jail on $9,000 bond, according to Jerry Cobb, a spokesman for Maricopa County Attorney’s Office. Taylor has pleaded not guilty. How can accidents be prevented? KidsAndCars has tips on how to keep the unthinkable from happening. Place something you’ll need, such as a cell phone, handbag or briefcase, near the child in the back seat. Keep a large stuffed animal in the child’s car seat when it’s not occupied. When the child is in the car seat, put the stuffed animal in the front passenger seat to remind you that the child is in the back. Tell a child’s day care center or babysitter that they will always be called if your child isn’t coming in as scheduled. If the child is absent without an explanation, the day care center or babysitter is expected to contact a parent or another designated caregiver. Those human tricks may be the best available options for caregivers. Technology, by and large, doesn’t seem to have caught up to the problem yet. Pam D’Angio with Texas-based Baby Alert International is trying to change that. The company has designed the ChildMinder Infant-Toddler Elite Pad System. It’s essentially a  sensor under an infant or child safety seat that is activated by a child’s weight. If someone tries to get out of the car without removing the infant, an alarm sounds on a key fob, she said. CNN’s Gary Tuchman tested the product with a Sugar Land, Texas, family. The ChildMinder appeared to work. But Tuchman noted that products like the ChildMinder are not foolproof. Batteries go low. Someone might not hear the alarm. And two years ago, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration issued a study that deemed devices intended to prevent infant car heatstroke deaths “inconsistent and unreliable.” Researchers noted numerous concerns, CNN reported in 2012. Some devices required caregivers to situate a child a certain way within a restraint. Others stop functioning when they get wet and cell phone interference hinders some, the report said. In its analysis – the first of its kind – the government stressed that the devices should not be the sole option for caregivers trying to avoid accidentally forgetting their child in a car. Memory expert Diamond argues that products like the ChildMinder could at least be a good start. A parent himself, he turned his attention to the topic of parents forgetting their children in cars when he was horrified by a news story about a Florida dentist whose son died in a hot car. “The bottom line is that there hasn’t been sufficient government funding to address this,” he said. “You put a man on the moon but you can’t detect a child in a car? If there were funding, there would be technology.” Diamond said in his car a sensor on the passenger side door rings if he puts a bag of groceries or something relatively heavy there. “If we can figure that out,” he said. “We can come up with something to tell us if our child is still in the car.” Hot-car death highlights key role of digital evidence",12520,Ashley Fantz,0.121,0.811,0.067,-0.9992

The 21-year-old stepson apparently shot himself Monday night after shooting the 52-year-old deputy as he slept, the deputy’s 36-year-old wife and the couple’s 12-year-old daughter, authorities said Tuesday. Each victim had a single gunshot wound, and no note was found, authorities said. Deputy Sam Driskell, a detective in charge of the sex offenders registry, had earlier been in the military for 20 years, and he met his wife, Muachin, while he was in the Dominican Republic, authorities said. The stepson was identified as Felix Almonte, authorities said. “There’s no rhyme or reason for it. All of my guys are heartbroken,” Paulding County Sheriff Gary Gulledge told reporters. The sheriff knew the slain deputy “all my life,” he said. “He’s here early and leaves late,” the sheriff said of Driskell. “He’s always the first one on the job.” The couple had a daughter, Carolyn, together, authorities said. She was the 12-year-old also found killed. “What we believe was they had some issue with the stepson,” the sheriff said of the family. There were no signs of domestic violence, the sheriff added. Driskell, a corporal, worked for the sheriff’s office for more than 10 years and had been recognized by the Georgia Bureau of Investigation for his work fighting sex crimes against children, authorities said. Driskell didn’t show up for court Tuesday, which was uncharacteristic of him, and his body and the others were discovered when deputies went to check on him, authorities said. Neighbors expressed deep concern Tuesday. “My grandpa called to let us know stay in the house, lock the doors,” Haley Smallwood told CNN affiliate WSB. “They told us everything they knew, that they were dead and they were found in the house. “They told us to be careful,” she added.",1964,Michael Martinez,0.079,0.921,0,-0.9766
97,97,01/07/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/06/us/saints-junior-galette-arrest-nfl-conduct/index.html,New Orleans Saint’s arrest 1st test of NFL new conduct policy,US,CNN,"There is no jarring video of a man clocking his fiancee in a casino elevator, no images of “switch” marks left on a small boy’s thighs. Still, Junior Galette’s arrest on a misdemeanor domestic violence-related charge is a serious issue for the NFL as it marks the first real test of the league’s new personal conduct policy. Authorities responded to the New Orleans Saints defensive end’s home Monday morning after receiving a call about a disturbance, according to a news release from Kenner, Louisiana, police. “Upon arrival, officers met with a 22-year-old female who was observed bleeding from her left ear, having an earring ripped from her ear, and scratch marks to her face,” the release said. Lt. Brian McGregor noted that Galette disputed the woman’s account, and in a statement provided to CNN, attorney Lon Burns said, “Junior Galette is concerned about working to clear his good name which he has established on and off the football field. … Friends of Mr. Galette’s pulled together and rallied around their friend, whom they know as ‘Junior,’ who has done much when asked for people around him here in the New Orleans area.” Later Tuesday, another attorney, Ralph Whalen, sent a statement saying he was “confident an investigation and a full hearing of the facts will reveal that Junior Galette behaved appropriately given the circumstances and in no way committed domestic violence or battery.” He said the woman threatened Galette and four others, including Galette’s girlfriend, with a knife. She had her earring ripped out when a “dog reacting to her yelling jumped on her,” Whalen said in his statement. “This was not domestic violence for many reasons, including the fact that the woman with the knife is not in a relationship with Mr. Galette nor do they live together. Also, there was there was no battery committed by Mr. Galette,” the statement said. The relationship between the woman, who police have not identified, and Galette is unclear. The woman told police she had lived with Galette for two years, doing chores and running errands for him, but had been asked to leave Monday morning, police said. Galette told police, though, that the woman was a dancer who was supposed to leave his home Sunday night but was allowed to stay until Monday morning. “There are some varying versions of what occurred,” McGregor said during a Monday news conference. ‘Then I grabbed a knife … ‘ According to the woman’s side of the story, she woke Galette up to request cab fare and he told his cousin and former Temple University teammate Terrance Banks “to take care of the request,” police said. McGregor read to reporters the woman’s account of what happened next: “We started arguing and Junior pushed me. He pushed me two times, trying to get me out the house and I fell down and they both was on me and I couldn’t breathe. I couldn’t fight both of them, then Terrance picked me up and put me out. I started to dial 911 and Terrance took my phone and wouldn’t give it back. Then I grabbed a knife because I thought they were going to jump me again.” Galette, 26, was arrested on a charge of simple battery involving domestic violence, and Banks, 26, was arrested on a simple battery charge. Galette posted a preset bond of $600 and Banks posted a $300 bond, and both were released from jail Monday, according to police. Galette is scheduled to appear in Kenner Mayor’s Court on February 26, McGregor told CNN. The incident report will not be released until Thursday or later, McGregor said, but the responding officers had no option but to arrest Galette and Banks, given the circumstances. Among the factors they considered, according to McGregor: Two large men were fighting with one woman, the nature of each party’s offensive and defensive injuries, the seriousness of the injuries, and the heights and weights of the parties involved. ‘When you go hands on with someone, you’ve gone too far,” the lieutenant said, explaining that the initial investigation indicated Galette and Banks were the “predominant aggressors.” Asked about Galette’s claim that he merely wanted the woman to leave his home, McGregor said, “All you had to do was call the Kenner Police Department, and we would’ve responded.” Policy put to work Galette’s arrest will be the first real test for the NFL’s new personal conduct policy, adopted last month after widespread uproar over the handling of the Ray Rice assault case and Adrian Peterson child abuse case, along with other lower-profile arrests. The policy calls on players, coaches, owners, game officials and other employees to be “people of high character,” and it expands the 2007 list of prohibited conduct, allows for independent investigations, creates criteria under which a player can be suspended with pay and establishes a group of outside advisers to review potential violations. “Conduct by anyone in the league that is illegal, violent, dangerous, or irresponsible puts innocent victims at risk, damages the reputation of others in the game, and undercuts public respect and support for the NFL,” the policy states. Perhaps most pertinent to Galette’s case, the policy also establishes a “baseline suspension without pay of six games” for any violation involving “assault, battery, domestic violence, dating violence, child abuse and other forms of family violence, or sexual assault involving physical force or committed against someone incapable of giving consent.” The suspension can be lengthened if the case involves aggravating factors, and a second offense could see a player banished from the league outright. Galette was apparently aware of this, as he told arresting officers the incident could affect his recent contract extension, McGregor told CNN. Under the extension, signed in September, the Saints will pay the Haitian-born defensive end with 31.5 career sacks as much as $52 million over six years, according to reports. He is slated to get a roster bonus of $12.5 million this year. “It had no bearing on our decision (to arrest him),” McGregor said of the contract. League, team investigating Regarding Galette’s status on the gridiron, a Saints spokesman told CNN on Monday, “We are aware and our security department is still collecting information.” League spokesman Greg Aiello told CNN the NFL is looking into the matter and there was nothing new to report Tuesday. He further explained how the league follows up on suspected violations, which includes making certain assistance available to the victim. For Galette, the NFL will offer and pay for a formal clinical evaluation, along with education and counseling, and if he participates, it will reflect positively “in determining eventual discipline if a violation is found,” according to the policy. The league will also conduct an investigation – tapping NFL security, independent parties or both – while cooperating with any law enforcement probes. “League and team employees are required to cooperate in any such investigation and are obligated to be fully responsive and truthful in responding to requests from investigators for information (testimony, documents, physical evidence, or other information) that may bear on whether the Policy has been violated. “A failure to cooperate with an investigation or to be truthful in responding to inquiries will be separate grounds for disciplinary action.”",7347,Eliott C.

98,98,01/07/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/07/us/recreational-marijuana-laws/index.html,It’s 2015: Is weed legal in your state?,US,CNN,"On Mondays, the Denver Kush Club in Colorado runs a special on various strains of recreational marijuana. Customers can score an eighth of an ounce of premium weed for the same price they’d normally pay for a lower-grade, then take it home and use it, just for fun. On any given Monday in Texas, possessing an eighth of an ounce of any grade marijuana is a misdemeanor that can land you in prison for up to 180 days. It carries a fine of up to $2,000. Possessing more than 2 ounces means an even harsher punishment. The two states illustrate a nation divided by the legalization of marijuana. Last year, a CNN/ORC International survey found 55% of those polled supported legalization; 44% opposed it. On January 1, Colorado celebrated its first anniversary of legal recreational marijuana sales. Washington state has allowed the sale of recreational weed since June 1, 2014. Oregon and Alaska will join them in 2016. Voters in the nation’s capital have also approved a recreational marijuana initiative, but the law is still pending congressional approval. Twenty-seven states and the District of Columbia have either legalized medical marijuana or decriminalized marijuana possession – or both. Yet Texas is one of 23 states that still prohibits cannabis outright. How did we get here? In 1970, Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act, which listed marijuana as a Schedule I drug. Since then, it has been illegal to manufacture, distribute or possess marijuana in the United States, according to the federal government. However in August 2013, the U.S. Justice Department said it wouldn’t challenge Colorado or other states with laws legalizing recreational marijuana. Instead, federal officials decided to focus on stopping drug trafficking and keeping marijuana away from children. In other words, states are effectively free to ignore the federal ban. So what happens if you’re caught with marijuana varies on where you are. Private possession of up to 1 ounce carries no penalty in Colorado, and growing up to six marijuana plants (with no more than three being mature) at home is perfectly legal for someone 21 or older. Washington state permits adults to possess up to 1 ounce of cannabis, and/or up to 16 ounces of marijuana-infused solid products and 72 ounces of marijuana-infused liquid products for their own private, personal use. Using marijuana in public is still a civil violation and subject to a fine. Similar to Washington and Colorado, the Oregon and Alaska laws will also create a commercial regulatory system for the production, distribution and sale of marijuana. D.C.’s proposal, while more reserved than others, allows for people 21 or older to possess up to 2 ounces of marijuana for personal use and grow up to six cannabis plants in their home. Yet Congress has authority over the city’s finances, so tucked into the recent spending bill is a provision that bars the District from using any of its own money or federal funds to regulate the use of pot. As previously mentioned, many states have decriminalized marijuana; it is still against federal law, but generally speaking, you won’t get prison time or a criminal record on first offenses for carrying small amounts for personal use. You can still be hit with a civil fine, similar to a minor traffic violation. These relaxed laws have pro-marijuana legalization activists enthused. Many are already looking toward 2016, when ballot initiatives in California, Massachusetts, Maine, Nevada and Arizona other states are likely to be put to voters. Movement on the medical front In August 2013, CNN’s Dr. Sanjay Gupta wrote an editorial, “Why I changed my mind on weed.” In it, he detailed the reasons he believes marijuana should not be listed as a Schedule I drug. “It doesn’t have a high potential for abuse, and there are very legitimate medical applications,” he wrote. Marijuana contains two main active ingredients: cannabidiol, or CBD, and tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC. The touted health benefits of these ingredients range from pain relief to seizure control. While the Drug Enforcement Agency has not made a change in its classification, many medical organizations have called for restrictions on research to be loosened. We need to know, they seem to be collectively saying, whether cannabis is more helpful or harmful. Most recently, the American Academy of Neurology released a position paper (PDF) in support of “efforts to conduct rigorous research to evaluate the long-term safety and effectiveness of marijuana-based products.” “Further research is needed to determine the benefits and safety of such products,” the authors wrote. “This is of paramount importance when marijuana-based products are used in patients with underlying neurologic disorders, or in children whose developing brains may be more vulnerable to the toxic effects of marijuana.” As restrictions loosen, the evidence for the legalization of medicinal marijuana is growing. A study published in August in JAMA Internal Medicine found that states that have legalized marijuana for managing chronic pain have significantly fewer deaths from prescription painkiller overdoses each year. Still, research on the long-term effects of marijuana use is limited. A study published in September in The Lancet showed teens who use marijuana daily before age 17 are more than 60% less likely to get their high school diploma than those who’ve never used pot. Daily adolescent users were 18 times more likely to become dependent on marijuana, seven times more likely to attempt suicide and eight times more likely to use other illegal drugs in the future. But is that because of their marijuana use? Or are other factors at play? Another study found that compared to nonusers, teens who smoked marijuana have less gray matter in their orbitofrontal cortexes – the area of the brain that helps you make decisions. Researchers have also found that the reward center in the brains of 18 to 25 year olds who smoke marijuana at least once a week is different than the reward center in those who have no history of cannabis use. Yet some studies suggest the long-term effects may not be as damaging as this research suggests. A small study of 110 adults published recently in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal found that while chronic marijuana users may have less gray matter, the connectivity channels in their brain are stronger, which could allow them to compensate, the study authors say. Many believe that as marijuana laws across the country continue to change, so too will the medical community’s opinion.",6592,Chris Boyette,0.071,0.822,0.108,0.9912
99,99,01/07/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/06/us/baltimore-police-gun-threat/index.html,Man with loaded gun walks into Baltimore police station,US,CNN,"The Baltimore Police Department is warning law enforcement agencies along the East Coast to take extra precautions in protecting their officers after a man carrying a .22 caliber handgun walked into one of the city’s police stations Tuesday morning on orders from the street gang Black Guerilla Family. Jason Armstrong, 29, told officers the gang ordered him into the station to test the security there, police said. Officers smelled marijuana on him and noticed him acting strangely, so they approached him, Police Commissioner Anthony W. Batts said. The Black Guerilla Family is a gang with ties to violence and drug trafficking in the Baltimore area, police said. Officers searched Armstrong and found the handgun, with a round loaded in the chamber. The man also had cocaine and marijuana, Batts said. “We are really lucky, for a person walking into a police station fully armed and loaded with guns on him, that it did not end up in a terrible situation,” said Batts. Police charged Armstrong with various weapons and narcotics violations. “An organized gang in the city of Baltimore sent an armed suspect into our building to see our security, to test our security. That is alarming to us,” Batts said. “In light of other incidents that have occurred in other cities, it has raised our level of concern.” Batts said he is calling a meeting with federal agencies including the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, and the Drug Enforcement Administration and has already sent an alert to other law enforcement agencies. “We’re not going to cower, we’re not going to back down, we’re not going to shy away from tough situations,” he said.  “We are going to be a Constitutional police department while we keep this city safe and continue to patrol the streets of the City of Baltimore.” Deputy Commissioner Jerry Rodriquez said, “This person did not go in there on his own free will. This person had very little option, according to his statement, which lends credibility to what a dire situation this was.” FBI spokesperson Minique Crump said the bureau is in communication with Baltimore police, but at this point it is a local matter being handled by Baltimore. Crump said the case is not related to a joint FBI-DHS bulletin sent in October warning law enforcement agencies across the country about potential attacks against police officers. The bulletin was sent after intelligence officials picked up chatter from ISIS members urging attacks against government officials, including law enforcement and military personnel.

100,100,01/07/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/05/us/new-york-officers-shot/index.html,"2 men arrested in shooting of NYPD officers, police say",US,CNN,"A pair of New York police officers shot and wounded while responding to an armed robbery in the Bronx were going off-duty and probably not wearing their bulletproof vests, police officials said Tuesday. In fact, Andrew Dossi, Aliro Pellerano and three other officers were changing clothes at the end of a dangerous anti-crime detail when they ran out of a Bronx station house to search for two robbery suspects, officials said. The suspects were arrested Tuesday. “Chances are they weren’t wearing their vests,” Chief of Department James O’Neill told reporters. “They were going home. They jumped into a car and they ended up getting into this fierce firefight.” The alleged shooter was identified as Jason Polanco, a 24-year-old boxer who was charged with five counts of attempted murder of a police officer and was said to have posted anti-police and anti-government statements on social media, police said. His alleged accomplice, Joshua Kemp, 28, was arrested on robbery charges. The wounded officers spent Tuesday at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. One of them, Dossi, who is 30 and has eight years on the job, was in stable condition following surgery after being shot in the arm and lower back, according to police. The other, Pellerano, who is 38 and has nine years as an officer, is in stable condition with gunshot wounds to the chest and arm. “Last night a team of our officers displayed extraordinary bravery, going above and beyond the call to protect their fellow New Yorkers,” Mayor Bill de Blasio, who has found himself at odds with some in his police force in recent weeks, said in a statement Tuesday.  “We thank these officers for their commitment to serving our city, including answering the call after their shift had ended. … This incident was yet another reminder of how profoundly important the work of our police officers is, as well as the seriousness of the dangers they face every day in the line of duty.” De Blasio also thanked New Yorkers who provided more than two dozen tips that helped identify the gunman.  Police said 10 of the tipsters identified Polanco by name. Monday night, authorities located the white Camaro that two suspects carjacked a block from the shooting, as well as a .44-caliber revolver, but no one was inside the vehicle. When bullets hit two off-duty NYPD officers in the Bronx on Monday, they also struck a nerve in the public psyche. The ambush style murder of two of their colleagues last month made it easy to assume the worst. ‘Extraordinarily brave’ The call about an armed robbery at a Bronx grocery store came in around 10:30 p.m. Monday, as five plainclothes officers were coming off their shift. Rather than going home, the police went to look for the criminals, something de Blasio described as “extraordinarily brave and … part of their commitment.” The officers exchanged gunfire with Polanco, police said, but the suspects got away, fleeing on foot for one block and then carjacking the Camaro. At tense time for police in city Sometime after the shooting, Kemp checked himself into a Manhattan hospital with a gunshot wound to the back, officials said. The man who drove him to the hospital was also taken into custody. Kemp, who has been arrested multiple times for robbery and was on parole, gave an account of how he was shot that didn’t add up, police said. “He told a story that didn’t seem factual, to be honest with you,” Robert Boyce, chief of detectives, told reporters. “He was not credible. … So, quickly the story didn’t add up and then we saw his background, that he was a Bronx guy and we started breaking the case.” The incident happened just south of Fordham University, an area hardly unfamiliar to violent crime. John Cardillo, who patrolled the area when he was a police officer, called it “a rough neighborhood in the ’90s, and it still is today… (It had and has) armed bad guys with the propensity to shoot someone.” The shootings have gotten heightened attention given when they happened – at a time of large-scale anti-police protests after a grand jury decided not to indict a white New York police officer in the death of Eric Garner, an African-American man. Even if it’s too early to tie it to this incident, experts in the law enforcement community have expressed concerns that such sentiment – views supported in some respects, according to some police, by de Blasio – will encourage violence against police. That’s what happened, they say, when Ismaaiyl Brinsley fatally ambushed NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu last month as they sat in their patrol car. “When the rhetoric turns anti-police, the police are concerned that people on the street, it’s going to increase the already existent lack of respect in certain segments of the society – including armed robbers … and other violent criminals,” said CNN law enforcement analyst Tom Fuentes, a former FBI assistant director. De Blasio has become a focal point for supporters of law enforcement, with some police even turning their backs on him at Ramos’ and Liu’s funerals because of their perception that he has been overly supportive of protesters and critical of police. “The relationship is toxic (and) almost irretrievable in some respects,” CNN political commentator Errol Louis said of the mayor-police dynamic. “This is not a good atmosphere.” On Tuesday, Patrick Lynch, the president of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, who has accused de Blasio of having “blood on his hands” after the two officers were killed in December, said in a statement: “New York City police officers, who could have closed their lockers and gone home after their shift ended, chose to respond to a robbery in progress and, sadly, were shot in the process. Our members are out there doing their jobs and putting themselves in danger to keep this city safe just as they always do.”",5841,Shimon Prokupecz,0.12,0.813,0.067,-0.9964
101,101,01/07/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/05/us/cold-weather-brisk-businesses/index.html,Business heats up for some as cold weather slams U.S.,US,CNN,"Ridiculously cold weather is gripping much of the country, and it’s going to get worse before it gets better. In Chicago, the high temperature Wednesday will be 1 degree Fahrenheit. Yes, that’s the high. And the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa will endure wind chills as low as 40 degrees below zero over the next two days. Even much of the South will be in a deep freeze by Wednesday morning. And folks from Ohio to Maryland can expect 3 to 7 inches of snow Tuesday. As of 12:30 p.m., 150 flights – most heading to the East Coast – were canceled at O’Hare International Airport in Chicago, and passengers at Chicago Midway International Airport were experiencing 20-minute delays and a dozen cancellations, transportation officials said. Affected by winter weather? Share your images with CNN iReport But not everyone is suffering. In fact, the brutal weather can be a financial boon. Here’s a look at some of the businesses whose sales grow hot when the days get cold: Hardware and grocery stores Some Iowa residents are stocking up on supplies, boosting the bottom lines of area hardware and grocery stores. “They’re preparing and planning ahead, which is really good so they don’t have to drive out in the streets,” Mark Hayman, owner of Hayman’s West Side Ace Hardware, told CNN affiliate KWQC. He said that sales of snow shovels and salt have doubled and that his staff is ready for the week. “We have a lot of shovels and salt that we keep in stock year-round,” Hayman told the affiliate. “We store them in the warehouse and make sure we don’t run out.” North Scott Foods, in Eldridge, is similarly stocked up and ready. A delivery truck that normally arrives Tuesday came earlier this week, ahead of the expected drop in temperature. “They wanted to make sure the roads were good. We told them, ‘good, come a day early; we’ll need it,’ ” assistant manager Jim Speirs told KWQC. Food deliveries For those who don’t stock up in time, never fear. Another type of business that sees its phones ring off the hook when the temperature drops is those specializing in deliveries. Who wants to go out on a cold day and brave the roads when there are others willing to deliver what you need? Malisha Spencer, manager at Indy All Night, which offers food delivery in Indianapolis nearly 24 hours a day, says business nearly doubles when a heavy cold front comes through. Daytime food delivery orders increase the most, she said. “Most of our deliveries usually come at night, but when it gets colder, we get them all throughout the day,” Spencer said. Salt sellers Salt: It’s not just for your grandma’s bland casserole. Salt for highway deicing makes up 41% of total salt sales in the U.S. So you can imagine that salt sellers aren’t as bummed out about the cold as regular Joes. During the snowstorms last year, Minnesota-based Cargill Inc. told The Wall Street Journal that the demand for deicing salt was “simply unprecedented in recent memory.” Auto repair shops Icy roads mean a big boost in business for auto repair shops. The cold makes cars more susceptible to damage. For example, a bumper that bends or dents in the summer can shatter in the winter, Brad Hamilton, manager of the Collision Center of Dayton, told CNN affiliate WDTN during last year’s cold spell. Plumbers There are lots of things homeowners can do to help avoid frozen pipes when temperatures drop. Michael Dunn, owner of M.T. Dunn Plumbing – which services the Portland, Oregon, area – lists some tips on his website. You can leave water dripping slowly from faucets, for example. Or set your home’s thermostat above 55 degrees. But even the best-laid plans can be no match for Mother Nature, which is where plumbers such as Dunn can step in. “It rarely gets that cold here, but when it does, it gets very hectic,” he said.

U.S. SKIERS KILLED Rising stars lost: An avalanche in Austria killed two young ski racers Monday. Ronnie Berlack, 20, and Bryce Astle, 19, were freeskiing at an Austrian resort. “Ronnie and Bryce were both outstanding ski racers who were passionate about their sport,” the U.S. Ski and Snowboard Association president said. Four other skiers with them were not injured. WEATHER Just ridiculous: The frigid weather gripping much of the country is only going to get worse. A second arctic blast will sweep through starting Tuesday, plunging temperatures to below 0 degrees in Chicago. The Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Iowa will endure wind chills as low as 40 degrees below zero. And Washington state has its own weather problems: 7 inches of rain in one day triggered a mudslide that knocked three homes off their foundations.

But, alerted by his two dachshunds, Larry Wilkins went to his door and opened it to see a young girl – her lips quivering, her nose bloodied, her arms and legs scratched up. And, somehow, still alive. “She told me that her mom and dad were dead,” Wilkins said of the girl, Sailor Gutzler. “And that she had been in a plane crash.” The girl’s sister and cousin also died when their Piper PA-34 aircraft went down Friday evening in western Kentucky. Even with the plane upside down, the 7-year-old made it out and trekked three-quarters of a mile in the dark through what Wilkins described as “very, very rough territory,” mired with fallen trees, creeks, ditches and blackberry briars. Sailor was barefoot except for one sock and was dressed for Florida – shorts, no coat – not for slogging through the January cold of Kentucky. Wilkins got her on his couch and called 911, alerting authorities that a plane had gone down and there was at least one survivor. Kentucky State Police troopers arrived in about 10 minutes. Sgt. Dean Patterson said the girl was taken to a local hospital with injuries that were not life-threatening. “She’s a terribly brave little girl, I’ll tell you that,” Wilkins said. “I can’t imagine a 7-year-old doing that.” FAA: Pilot reported engine problems The plane Sailor was on had left the warm, sunny climes of Key West, Florida, earlier Friday, heading for Mount Vernon, Illinois, a city roughly 80 miles east of St. Louis. Until something went wrong. Federal Aviation Administration spokeswoman Kathleen Bergen explained that air traffic controllers “lost contact with a Piper PA-34 aircraft … shortly after the pilot reported engine problems and (said) that he was diverting to the Kentucky Dam State (Park) Airport.” The twin-engine aircraft didn’t make it, crashing in Lyon County, about 30 miles east of Paducah, and less than 10 miles from the airport. Two National Transportation Safety Board members left Washington late Saturday morning for Kentucky, agency spokesman Keith Holloway said. They will join FAA investigators there to try to find out what caused the crash. Kentucky State Police identified the dead early Saturday as Marty Gutzler, 48; Kimberly Gutzler, 46; and 9-year-old Piper Gutzler – a husband, wife and their daughter. Also killed was 14-year-old Sierra Wilder, the survivor’s cousin. All were from Nashville, Illinois, a community of just over 3,000 people. Lt. Brent White told CNN affiliate KFVS that first responders “worked tirelessly to find this wreckage and hopefully salvage the lives of those that were on board.” “But, ultimately, it just wasn’t meant to be.” Their bodies were removed and the plane was covered early Saturday morning, Lyon County Judge Executive Wade White said. Patterson, with the state police, said that members of the NTSB were expected to arrive later in the day. Inclement weather was hampering the investigation, he said in a statement. “Officials have indicated a minimum of two days to conduct an investigation at the scene,” he said. Marty Gutzler’s Facebook page showed photos of his smiling daughters, political posts and his family sitting in a small plane with him at the controls. The latest one is of him and his wife celebrating New Year’s Eve at a Key West resort. The Rev. Matthew Wietfeldt of Nashville’s Trinity Lutheran Church said those killed – whom he’s known for four years – “will be deeply missed.” “The Gutzlers were a wonderful family and wonderful members of our congregation and community,” Wietfeldt said. Kent Plotner, an attorney representing the family, said in a statement, “The Gutzler family mourns the loss of Marty, Kim and Piper Gutzler and Sierra Wilder. We are devastated by this loss, but are confident that they rest in God’s loving arms.  We ask that you respect our privacy at this difficult time.  Please pray for us, especially for Sailor Gutzler.” A fund has been set up “for the benefit of Sailor Gutzler,” at sailorgutzlerfund.com, Plotner said. “The family thanks you for the heartfelt words of sympathy that have been expressed during this unimaginable loss,” he added. Plane crash sole survivors wrestle with guilt Police: ‘It’s just really a miracle’ How the youngest person on the plane managed to emerge alive also hit close to home for many like Trooper White, who has an 8-year-old girl of his own. “When I saw … what appeared to be a 7-year-old child that had walked through this dense forest and through some really tough terrain and some awfully poor conditions tonight and survived this,” he said, “it’s just really a miracle.” Wilkins says he believes  Sailor saw his street lights through the woods and, thankfully, found him – in one of only three homes in his neighborhood that are occupied in winter. White, the Lyon County executive, said the fact she went that way “saved her life.” “Any other direction could have ended badly with the cold weather,” he said. Sailor was released from Lourdes Hospital in Paducah just after 1 a.m. Saturday, state police said. Thinking about what the 7-year-old went through and what comes next brings tears to Wilkins’ eyes, he said. “I just feel so sorry for that little girl, I can’t understand it,” Wilkins said. “I just can’t imagine (going through) that, for someone that young.” I was the sole survivor: 4 stories of plane crash survival",5355,Greg Botelho,0.09,0.813,0.096,0.7224
104,104,01/06/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/06/us/spacex-rocket-launch/index.html,Pioneering SpaceX rocket launch aborted,US,CNN,"Private spaceflight company SpaceX scrubbed a scheduled rocket launch Tuesday, in which it planned to attempt the pioneering step of landing the rocket’s first stage on a floating platform. The next possible launch attempt is at 5:09 a.m. ET Friday, NASA said via Twitter, “pending resolution of the issue.” NASA and SpaceX said the problem was with the Falcon 9 rocket’s second stage, rather than the section it plans to try to land. “During the terminal count engineers observed drift on one of the two thrust vector actuators on the second stage that would likely have caused an automatic abort. Engineers called a hold in order to take a closer look,” said John Taylor, of SpaceX communications. The thrust vector control actuators are used to steer the rocket in flight. The second stage of the rocket delivers the payload – in this case, supplies for the International Space Station – to the desired orbit. SpaceX’s attempt to land the Falcon 9 rocket’s first stage has been the chief focus of interest ahead of its latest resupply mission. Recycling rockets Traditionally, rockets have been designed to fall back to Earth after separating from the spacecraft they lifted, and then burn up on re-entry or crash into the ocean. The millions of dollars that go into the production of the rockets burn, too. SpaceX wants to pioneer a reusable rocket, a development that could change the economics of space travel. “A fully and rapidly reusable rocket – which has never been done before – is the pivotal breakthrough needed to substantially reduce the cost of space access,” SpaceX said in a statement. The company has twice attempted soft landings of the Falcon 9’s first stage on water. Those tests showed that the rocket is capable of reducing its speed from hypersonic to nearly zero, and deploy landing legs. In those tests, the rocket tipped sideways and crashed into the ocean, causing damage that made the rocket unusable. That was according to plan, SpaceX said. Landing on a moving target When the launch happens, the company will try the same soft landing for the Falcon 9’s first stage, but this time on a custom-built floating platform it calls the autonomous spaceport drone ship. Landing on the platform “is significantly more challenging” than the water landings, the company said. For one, the platform is not anchored, and while it looks large from the ground, it is a rather small target for the 14-story-tall rocket. SpaceX described reentry and landing as “trying to balance a rubber broomstick on your hand in the middle of a wind storm.” The company puts the odds of success at 50% at best. It adds, however, that this is just the first of a number of tests toward the goal of landing a rocket stage for reuse. As for the target, “X” marks the spot: The company will try to land the rocket stage on the SpaceX logo painted on the center of the floating platform. Keith Smith, of Britain’s Royal Astronomical Society, told CNN the reason for using the platform – despite the complications of landing on a moving target – was that it should prevent any properties on Earth being damaged if the landing goes wrong. It’s not unusual for a launch to be aborted, he said, since there are so many elements at play. “The payload on this is so expensive to launch that you don’t want to risk anything about it,” he said. The timing of the next launch attempt will depend on how serious the problem is, he said.",3426,Mariano Castillo,0.033,0.923,0.044,0.8074
105,105,01/06/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/06/us/bill-cosby-accusers-defamation-lawsuit/index.html,2 more women join defamation lawsuit against Bill Cosby,US,CNN,"As Bill Cosby faces a slew of sexual assault allegations, two women are joining a defamation lawsuit against him. Linda Traitz told CNN that she and  fellow accuser Therese Serignese are joining the suit, which was originally filed by Tamara Green. Traitz, Serignese and Green are three of at least 23 women who have accused the comedian of sexual misconduct ranging from groping to rape. And after each came forward with the allegations, they were called liars by representatives for Cosby, the defamation suits says. Cosby’s attorney, Martin Singer, has called the spate of sexual assault accusations against the comedian “ridiculous.” He told CNN it defies common sense that “so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years.” CNN was unable to reach Singer for comment about the latest development. Here are the claims of the three women in the suit: Linda Joy Traitz Traitz said Cosby pushed himself on her when she worked as a waitress at a restaurant in Los Angeles that Cosby co-owned when she met him in 1969. Traitz was either 18 or 19 at the time, she said; she did not recall exactly. But she was fresh out of high school and new to the city, she said. Cosby offered her a ride home but on the way, told her he’d like to swing by the beach with her in his Rolls Royce, she said. They parked, and he offered her drugs, an array of brightly colored pills, “to relax,” she alleged. She said no, a few times. “He kept offering me the pills,” she alleged. She claimed that he then groped her chest, pushing her down in the seat and toward the door, and tried to lie on top of her. Singer, Cosby’s attorney, has said her account was not true. “Ms. Traitz is the latest example of people coming out of the woodwork with fabricated or unsubstantiated stories about my client,” Singer has said. Numerous arrests speckle Traitz’s rap sheet, including on suspicion of theft, battery and types of deception – fraud and impersonation – often in connection with drug possession. But Traitz spoke openly about her record to CNN, including her last arrest in 2008, which led to more than three years in prison for drug trafficking and possession. “When I got sent to prison … it saved my life,” Traitz said. “It was a great experience for me.” She said it ended her addiction to pain pills, and she’s been clean ever since. Therese Serignese Florida nurse Therese Serignese, 57, told ABC’s 20/20 that she was a 19-year-old model visiting Las Vegas when Cosby told her to take some pills in a private dressing room following a performance. After taking the pills, she remembered “feeling drugged, and I was kind of leaning forward, and he was behind me having sex with me. And I – I remember it because it was not good.” Serignese never made public accusations in the immediate aftermath. She explained her decision in an article she wrote in Friday’s New York Daily News. “Cosby was everywhere. Everyone thought he was a great family man. I knew he wasn’t. I just couldn’t prove it with anything but my word. There was no video camera or DNA evidence. No one else had accused him publicly yet,” Serignese wrote. Serignese says she wanted to testify in support of Andrea Constand, who filed a civil lawsuit against Cosby. “When the first victim came forward in 2005, I was angry that he called her a liar. I wanted to back her up. But even then I worried about the repercussions. I had younger children then,” Serignese wrote. “Ten years ago, the climate still wasn’t right,” she said. “We would have all been humiliated. Now, I could see it was time, and I would be safer. I wouldn’t be alone. It took me 38 years to feel safe. Tamara Green According to her lawsuit, Green was an aspiring model in 1970 who met Cosby through a mutual friend. The two met for lunch, even though Green was feeling ill, the document states. Cosby allegedly gave Green some pills, saying they were cold medicine – but Green started feeling “weak, dizzy and woozy.” Cosby took her to her apartment and started “groping me and kissing me and touching me and handling me and you know, taking off my clothes,” Green told NBC’s “Today” show. Cosby allegedly left two $100 bills on her coffee table and left, the lawsuit says.",4333,Holly Yan,0.102,0.824,0.074,-0.966

But that’s what parts of Minnesota will experience this week. And plenty of others will be freezing as well. “We’re looking at 50 million people in 24 states that are going to see some of the coldest weather over the next several days that we have seen in quite some time,” CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said. Here’s what to expect across the country: THE MIDWEST: Unfathomable chill If you want to know what 50 below zero (-45 degrees Celsius) feels like, just go to northern Wisconsin or Minnesota on Monday. Wind chills will dip to negative 25 to 50 (-32 to -45 degrees Celsius) there and in parts of North Dakota. “This arctic cold is potentially deadly and dangerous,” Maginnis said. “And a second blast of cold air will reinforce the deep freeze on Tuesday.” By Monday night, Antarctica was downright balmy compared to the bone-chilling temperatures across the Midwest. A temperature of 37 degrees Fahrenheit (2.8 degrees Celsius) was recorded at McMurdo Station, a U.S. research center in Antarctica, while in Duluth, Wisconsin, it was a mere -2 degrees (-19 degrees Celsius). Not much better was Green Bay, where a temperature of 1 degree (-17 degrees Celsius) was recorded, and 7 degrees (-14 degrees Celsius) in Chicago. Of course, it is summer in Antarctica. The Midwest is far from alone. “About 70% of the United States is going to feel very cold temperatures in the coming couple of days,” CNN meteorologist Pedram Javaheri said. No more snow days: School at home? THE NORTHEAST: A cocktail of nasty precipitation Snow, sleet and freezing rain will pummel parts of upstate New York and New England. “An Arctic airmass that already invaded the north central U.S. will spread southeastward, plunging temperatures from the Mississippi Valley to East Coast,” the National Weather Service said. New York City temperatures will dive to about 8 degrees (-13 degrees Celsius) Thursday morning. Oh, and there will be blustery winds to boot. THE WEST: Snow from Washington to the Grand Canyon Get ready for widespread precipitation across the Northwest early this week. “Heavy rains are expected along the Washington coast while snowfall accumulations in excess of a foot will be possible in the Cascades and northern Rockies,” the National Weather Service said. Nearly 12 inches of rain was recorded in 24 hours on the southwest slopes of the Olympic Mountains, the National Weather Service in Seattle tweeted Monday. Residents in the Seattle region were keeping a wary eye on nearby rivers, rapidly rising with the heavy rain. “We don’t know what is still yet to come,” said Mark Stewart, spokesman for the State Emergency Operations Center. In Hoquiam, 7 inches of rain over the past 24 hours triggered a mudslide that knocked at least three homes off their foundations, according to Lt. David Porter of the Grays Harbor County Sheriff’s Department. No one was injured. “They heard the loud crashing of trees and were able to get out,” Porter said. Hoquiam residents were being urged to evacuate for at least 24 hours. Up to 300 people in the Beacon Hill area of the city were being escorted out of their neighborhood Monday evening because of a mudslide. Several other slides were reported elsewhere in the county, blocking roads. Farther south, snow has already blanketed Southern Californian mountains, cacti in the Southwest and parts of the Grand Canyon. THE SOUTHEAST: From tornadoes to bitter cold Fresh off a spate of weekend tornadoes, the Southeast will now have to deal with an onslaught of frigid air. Mississippi is cleaning up from four tornadoes Saturday, and two other twisters struck Alabama. Up next: A midweek freeze that will leave even Floridians shivering. Atlanta will get well below freezing, culminating in a dip to 16 degrees (-9 degrees Celsius) on Wednesday morning. The blast from the north could be strong enough to push not just to Florida, but also into the Caribbean. “It staggers the imagination,” Sater said. “There’s a change a-coming.” Are you there?

His son, Thomas Gilbert Jr., was arrested on suspicion of homicide and criminal possession of a weapon. His father, Thomas Gilbert Sr., 70, founded the biotech and health care-focused hedge fund, Wainscott Capital Partners Fund, in 2011. His wife found his body in their eighth-floor apartment about 3:30 p.m Sunday. He had been shot in the head. At the scene, officers found a gun resting on Gilbert Sr.’s chest, with his left hand covering it, NYPD Chief of Detectives Bob Boyce told reporters. They saw what they perceived to be a staged crime scene, Boyce said, and set up surveillance at the son’s apartment. Officers executed a search warrant at the son’s apartment and found several pieces of potential evidence: magazine clips, loose rounds, a manufacturer’s box of a Glock .40 caliber and a shell casing envelope with the serial number of the gun recovered at the crime scene, according to Boyce. Gilbert Sr.’s Beeckman Place apartment sits on a quiet street that houses several diplomats. “Something just kaboom, just hit the floor loudly,” said Christopher Kelly, who lives below Gilbert Sr.’s apartment, describing what he heard to CNN affiliate WABC. “That’s all I heard – like something dropped somewhere.”",1319,David Shortell,0.121,0.85,0.029,-0.9694

They are doing everything they can to make the 7-year-old feel safe and loved – a simple but critical act that mental health experts say can help the child begin grappling with being the sole survivor of a plane crash that killed her parents, sister and cousin. Family members will raise Sailor, and money from a family-sanctioned online fund will help, said Gutzler family spokesman Kent Plotner, an attorney who personally knows the family. But out of concern for the girl’s healing, Plotner said there will be no more details released about her. “Our total focus is protecting her,” he said. Sailor’s father was a longtime pilot, Plotner said, and his children flew with him many times. On Friday, a Piper PA-34 that was carrying the family went down in western Kentucky. Even though the aircraft was upside down, Sailor managed to make it out and walk three-quarters of a mile in the dark through very rough terrain, across fallen trees and ditches. She navigated around creeks and over blackberry briars despite wearing only one sock, a T-shirt and shorts, and no coat. Mother remembers last moments with daughter lost in Kentucky plane crash She knocked on Larry Wilkins’ door. “She said, ‘My mom and dad are dead. We had a plane crash. The plane was upside down.’” On CNN Monday, Wilkins said the girls’ legs were cut and scratched from the bottom of her shorts to the tips of her toes. She was a little wet because it was drizzling. Wilkins put her on his couch and called 911, alerting authorities that a plane had gone down and there was at least one survivor. Wilkins said his two Dachshunds helped calm the girl down. The child’s grandfather later told him that she had a Dachshund. “I know she’s having an extremely hard time and probably in her mind she doesn’t understand everything that’s going on,” said Wilkins. Though she was trembling and crying, the little girl seemed “amazingly composed,” he said, given the circumstances. Read: 7-year-old survives plane crash that kills family Grief in a child’s mind Children who experience the sudden loss of a family member process that grief in ways that are specific to their age, say mental health specialists who treat young patients. Losing one relative elicits complex feelings; losing several relatives, particularly parents, is uniquely overwhelming. On top of her grief, Sailor will also have to grapple with the trauma she endured being part of the event that killed them. “It’s critical that Sailor feel safe and loved – that has to happen right away,” said Dr. J. William Worden, a psychologist who has treated grieving children and co-directed Harvard’s seminal study on childhood bereavement. The Gutzler family is not saying where the child is living, and that’s a very good move, Worden said. Journalists camping outside her door could scare and traumatize her, he said. Other mental health experts who specialize in treating children advise that the family try to keep as normal a routine as possible. They must keep in mind that grief is a process. It’s not a problem to be fixed. There’s no rush, they say, for her to see a counselor. And it could be damaging for an interviewer without training in child trauma to question her now, said Dr. Donald Freedheim, a professor emeritus of psychology at Case Western University. He has treated children after disasters. “If they called me, I wouldn’t say, ‘Send her to my office.’ I’d go to her home and we’d just sit down. I would be a friend. She can’t feel threatened in any way,” he said. Let the child lead Sailor should be allowed to provide cues as to how adults behave around her. “If she wants to talk about what happened, let her. If she doesn’t, then let her be for a little while,” Worden said. “When you have too many losses in too short a period of time, in children, their grieving process can shut down.” Sometimes, children develop somatic symptoms in place of grieving. Young children act out because they don’t have the developmental tools yet to articulate how they feel. Older children and teenagers sometimes get headaches, stomachaches or anxiety disorders, he said. Each of Sailor’s relatives’ deaths should be addressed separately, experts advise. The way Sailor will process the loss of her sister is apart from the way she will grieve for her mother. Sailor will deal with those losses differently as she gets older. She will feel them differently from the way she felt them at ages 12, 18 and 25, said Dr. Therese Rando of The Institute for the Study and Treatment of Loss in Rhode Island. A 7-year-old generally understands what death is but doesn’t yet have the ability to comprehend the implications of it, experts say. A common coping mechanism at that age is denial, said Rando. The adult world is stunned and impressed that Sailor managed to get up from the wreckage site, walk in the dark, in frigid temperatures, across a rough, wooded area to get to a man’s house, knock on the door, tell that stranger what happened and ask for help. But that action shouldn’t be interpreted as a sign that Sailor is somehow more capable of recovering than any other child who faces such a horrific tragedy. “She may have acted amazingly composed,” said Rando. “But what might be happening on the outside isn’t necessarily what’s happening on the inside. She will have to deal with this trauma in a way that unfolds over a lot of time. She will have to work this for the rest of her life.” Still, AC Morgan, who survived a small plane crash himself in 1998, encouraged Sailor to draw on that same strength she showed after the crash as she faces a challenging healing process. “If you ever question if you can do it, look back at what you did – you were able to get out of a plane, you were able to walk three-quarters of a mile in the dark, by yourself and find safety. You can do it, no matter what.” I was the sole survivor: 4 stories of plane crash survival",5990,Ashley Fantz,0.155,0.779,0.066,-0.9989
109,109,01/05/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/04/us/new-york-detective-liu-funeral/index.html,"A second officer’s funeral, a second show of dissent toward mayor",US,CNN,"For the second time in days, New York police – joined by officers from departments across the country – buried one of their own Sunday. And again, a silent protest in blue repeated itself as some officers turned their backs on the city’s mayor. The show of dissent happened a week earlier at the funeral for Officer Rafael Ramos, who was killed along with Officer Wenjian Liu as the two patrol partners sat in their squad car. On Sunday at the funeral for Liu, it appeared fewer officers turned their backs as Mayor Bill de Blasio spoke than during the service for Ramos. Before Liu’s service, Police Commissioner William Bratton had asked that officers refrain from acting disrespectfully. Some officers have accused the mayor of encouraging anti-police fervor because of his support of protests against police brutality. Tens of thousands had taken to the streets after the death of African-American Eric Garner during an encounter with white NYPD officers in July. Pat Lynch, head of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association, has taken aim at de Blasio, even saying the mayor’s office was stained with the two dead officers’ blood. But before Sunday’s funeral, Bratton urged officers to be reverent. “A hero’s funeral is about grieving, not grievance,” Bratton said in a memo. He said the earlier display put all NYPD officers in a bad light. “It stole the valor, honor and attention that rightfully belonged to the memory of detective Rafael Ramos’s life and sacrifice,” his memo read. On Saturday, there was no protest by the police against the mayor. Several officers saluted de Blasio when he arrived for Liu’s wake. The best of what the U.S. can be At the Sunday service, the slain New York Police officer was remembered as a family man, a dedicated police officer, an avid fisherman and a person who embraced the best of what the United States can be. Liu was 12 when his parents emigrated with him in 1994 from Canton, China. His family said that the first souvenir he bought when he arrived was a sticker of the Statue of Liberty. He valued law and order and always wanted to be an officer. Weeping, his wife Pei Xia Chen told the thousands of mourners who gathered at Brooklyn’s Aievoli Funeral Home that her husband was dedicated to his job and he understood the awesome responsibility it entailed. “We spoke about work often,” she said, “and how much respect he had for the law, how he applied the law … with courtesy, with respect and with the highest professionalism.” The couple had been married for only two months when Liu was shot to death December 20 as he sat in his patrol car next his partner, Officer Rafael Ramos. In uniform, Ramos and Liu were apparently murdered simply because they were cops. Their killer had posted on social media his desire to end police officers’ lives. In the immediate aftermath of the slayings, de Blasio called the attack on the officers an attack on all New Yorkers. On Sunday, the mayor said that Liu, as well as Ramos, “embodied our city’s most cherished values.” “(In their deaths, we lost) the very best of us. … We lost two individuals who were showing us the way,” the mayor told mourners. Ramos saw his work as ministry and was posthumously appointed honorary NYPD chaplain. He was just hours away from becoming a lay chaplain and graduating from a community-crisis chaplaincy program before his death. He left behind a wife, Maritza, and two sons, Justin and Jaden. Though he majored in accounting in college, Liu joined the police force where he served for seven years. He used his Chinese-language skills as whenever he could, his family said. Bratton described him as an especially empathetic person who often listened to the people he served in New York. Being a cop is about more than paperwork and arrests and keeping watch, Bratton said, it’s also about being kind. “For seven years, he sought out” those who were suffering and tried to ease that. At Ramos’ funeral last weekend, Bratton promoted both men to the rank of detective, first grade. Officer Liu “believed in the possibility … of a city free of fear,” Bratton said, and is the type of “officer that we want … and the type that we have.” De Blasio praised Liu for his love of family. The officer rarely took time off but when he did, Liu went fishing. And in those wonderful moments when he caught a big fish, he would share it with his parents and his wife. He was a “brave and skilled police officer but he was also a kind man, a kind officer, someone who gave of himself,” the mayor said. “He wanted to help others in everything he did.” Liu “walked a path of courage, path of sacrifice, a path of kindness,” the mayor continued. “This city welcomed Detective Liu. New York stands a little taller today because of the time he walked among us.” FBI director James Comey was the first to address mourners, speaking about what drives officers to do their job despite the risks. “They want to do good … they want to make ordinary life” better,” he said. Though political and law enforcement leaders gave moving comments, hearing from Liu’s family members was truly heartbreaking. Liu’s father wept as he praised his son in Cantonese, saying he was grateful for how much Liu cared for him. Pei Xie Chen spoke directly to her husband: “You were an amazing man.” Diversity and unity The ceremonial burning of paper money and the melodic sounds of Buddhist chants marked Liu’s wake Saturday. There were throngs of police officers – many who had traveled from across the country to pay respects in New York. They represented many different cultural backgrounds, like Ramos and Liu. Ramos, a New York native of Puerto Rican descent, was remembered last week at a massive gathering at a Protestant church in Queens. “This was his dream, to become an NYPD officer,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said outside Liu’s wake Saturday. “In some ways, it’s the ultimate assimilation into America, into New York, to become a police officer. And obviously he was so proud, and he was so proud for his whole family.” Cuomo was unable to attend Sunday’s service due the recent death of his father. After Liu’s funeral, Lynch of the Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association told reporters that some officers “feel like they were turned upon by City Hall and we have a right to express our opinions as well, and they did respectfully.” Officers who turned their backs when the mayor spoke did not act, Lynch said, “inside a church, not inside the service, but outside where it should be done, on the streets, like we have a right to do.” “This was an organic gesture that started on the streets of New York, and it should be respected,” he said. After Sunday’s service, a drum corps played as officers walked block after block as Liu’s body was transported from the funeral home. Officers from around the country joined local officers paying tribute. For more than a half mile away in any direction from the procession, one could see a huge wall of police uniforms.",6962,Ashley Fantz,0.09,0.764,0.146,0.9982

You know it’s going to be bad when 0 degrees Fahrenheit (-17 Celsius) will be the high temperature. “We’re looking at 50 million people in 24 states that are going to see some of the coldest weather over the next several days that we have seen in quite some time,” CNN meteorologist Karen Maginnis said Sunday. The National Weather Service predicted heavy rains and mountain snow in the Northwest, and snows from the northern Plains to the northern Mid-Atlantic states. “An Arctic air mass that already invaded the north central U.S. will spread southeastward … plunging temperatures from the Mississippi Valley to East Coast. “The cold air blowing over warmer waters will allow snow showers to crank up across the Great Lakes region … especially downwind of Lake Ontario and Erie,” it said in a forecast. Wind chill warnings and advisories were in effect for much of Wisconsin, Minnesota and parts of North Dakota and Illinois. “It staggers the imagination,” Sater said. “There’s a change a-coming.” Are you there?

112,112,01/05/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/04/us/stuart-scott-remembered/index.html,ESPN’s Stuart Scott inspired those battling cancer,US,CNN,"If you don’t know who Stuart Scott was, those who do will likely point you to one particular speech to share why his death reverberates so strongly across the country. Scott, a veteran anchor on ESPN, died Sunday after a seven-year battle with cancer. He was 49. He built a career as a sports anchor, but his eloquent observations on his battle with cancer, and the encouragement and motivation to others fighting the disease, made him a role model. Opinion: Why Scott was a game changer “When you die, that does not mean you lose to cancer,” Scott said in the July speech at the ESPY Awards. “You beat cancer by how you live, why you live and the manner in which you live.” It is a line that anyone who has lost a loved one to cancer can take comfort in, and one being repeated much on Sunday, following Scott’s death. Scott was accepting the Jimmy V Perseverance Award at the ESPYs, and honored the award’s namesake – college basketball coach and broadcaster Jim Valvano – by reflecting on Valvano’s own speech in 1993. “I listened to what Jim Valvano said 21 years ago, the most poignant seven words ever uttered in any speech anywhere: ‘Don’t give up. Never give up,’” Scott said. “I’m not special; I just listen to what the man said. I listen to all that he said, everything that he asked of us.” Scott worked for ESPN for 21 years, and is credited with coining catchphrases like “Boo-yah” and “as cool as the other side of the pillow.” He was born in Chicago and grew up in North Carolina. His early career took him from Florence, South Carolina, to Raleigh, North Carolina, and later to Orlando. Scott was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2007. During that speech, Scott spoke of counting on others for help, and the comfort of family members, even if only to cry with them on the phone. His message was this: “So live, live. Fight like hell.” In that same speech, Scott made it clear what his priorities were. “I have one more necessity – it’s really two,” he said, referring to his daughters. “The best thing I have ever done, the best thing I will ever do, is be a dad to Taelor and Sydni. It’s true.” Rich Eisen, a sportscaster for NFL Network who was previously Scott’s SportsCenter partner at ESPN, asked for prayers for Scott’s family during an emotional segment Sunday. “He battled cancer as bravely as anybody else, and I know there many people out there who are battling cancer right now,” Eisen said. “Stuart would want you to know to keep fighting.” His ESPN colleagues likewise honored him on air. “Our colleague, our friend, and our inspiration Stuart Scott passed away earlier today,” ESPN’s Hannah Storm said. President Barack Obama said that although his travels often kept him away from his family, Scott and the “SportsCenter” crew kept him company on his trips. “Over the years, he entertained us, and in the end, he inspired us – with courage and love,” Obama said in a statement.",2908,Mariano Castillo,0.122,0.71,0.168,0.983
113,113,01/04/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2014/07/16/us/legal-drinking-age/index.html,Should the U.S. lower its drinking age?,US,CNN,"Dwight B. Heath knows what he is about to say will sound a little crazy to most people. When asked what the minimum legal drinking age should be in the U.S., Heath says 8, or maybe even 6. No, the Brown University anthropology professor is not advocating getting kids drunk. Instead he favors a cultural model, common in countries like France or Italy, where parents serve small amounts of wine to their children at family meals. By doing this, he says, parents educate their kids about alcohol and rob drinking of its taboo allure, which can make rebellious teenagers sneak off to basements and backwoods to binge drink far from adult supervision. “In general, the younger people start to drink the safer they are,” said Heath, who has written several books and hundreds of scholarly articles on cultural attitudes towards alcohol. When introduced early, he said, “Alcohol has no mystique. It’s no big deal. By contrast, where it’s banned until age 21, there’s something of the ‘forbidden fruit’ syndrome.” Of course, Heath’s idea has no chance of becoming law anytime soon. Thirty years ago this week, Congress passed a bill that effectively raised the national drinking age to 21. Despite subsequent efforts to lower it in some states – and the fact that most developed countries allow young people to legally drink at 18 – that threshold has remained firmly in place ever since. Proponents of the higher drinking age says it reduces traffic fatalities and alcohol-related accidents while keeping booze out of the hands of teens, whose brains are still developing. But as the U.S. marks Thursday’s anniversary of the National Minimum Drinking Age Act, Heath and some other scholars still dare to ask an unpopular question: Would America be better served by reducing its drinking age – or at least encouraging states to set their own limits? The World Health Organization cites the U.S. as one of only a handful of developed countries – Iceland, Japan, South Korea and Thailand are others – with a minimum drinking age over 18. Several countries, including Belgium, Denmark and Germany, even allow 16-year-olds to buy beer and wine. “I think 18 is viewed (by most countries) pretty much as a reasonable age limit,” said Marjana Martinic, deputy president of the International Center for Alcohol Policies or ICAP. “The Puritan ethic has really shaped the way alcohol is regulated in the U.S.,” Martinic said. “Alcohol is seen more as a drug, and not something that’s integrated into everyday life.” MADD about underage drinking Two generations of younger Americans have never known anything but needing to be 21 – or owning an ID that says you are – to buy a six-pack or drink in a bar. But in the wide-lapeled 1970s, things were very different. After Congress in 1971 dropped the voting age from 21 to 18, many states followed suit by lowering decades-old barriers to drinking. The rationale went something like this: If young Americans could be entrusted to vote, serve on a jury and fight in Vietnam, why couldn’t they order a beer? By the late 1970s, more than half the states in the U.S. had lowered their minimum drinking ages, usually from 21 to 18. But when research showed an increase in traffic fatalities in these states, state legislatures began to reverse course. Mothers Against Drunk Driving, founded in 1980, quickly gained national clout and lobbied lawmakers to raise the legal limit. On July 17, 1984, Congress passed a law that withheld federal highway funding from every state that continued to allow people under 21 to buy alcohol – effectively forcing them to raise their drinking ages. By 1995, faced with this strong financial incentive and pressure from MADD, all 50 states and the District of Columbia had complied. Is alcohol and the teen brain a bad mix? Many studies have since attempted to gauge the law’s impact on public health. One found that among young drivers (ages 16-20) killed in car wrecks, the percentage with positive blood-alcohol levels declined from 61% in 1982 to 31% in 1995 – a bigger decline than for older age groups. “Minimum legal drinking age laws have proven to be a very effective and important countermeasure for reducing drunk driving when younger drivers are involved,” said the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration in a statement. The NHTSA estimates that raising the national legal drinking age from 18 to 21 has saved more than 500 lives each year. “Research shows that it saves lives,” agreed MADD National President Jan Withers. “In fact, it is one of the most researched public health laws on the books. When the law was raised to 21, alcohol-related deaths for young people decreased; when the drinking age was lowered, deaths increased.” A recent study in New Zealand, which lowered its drinking age in 1999 from 20 to 18, found that drivers aged 18 or 19 now face a higher risk of being involved in alcohol-related crashes that cause death or injury. The 21-year-old limit may be less effective at curbing binge drinking on college campuses, however. A University of Indiana study of students at 56 colleges found that in the immediate aftermath of 21 becoming the national drinking age, significantly more underage students drank compared to those of legal age. A stalled movement There’s a movement to lower legal drinking ages in the U.S., and its leader is not a college student or a brewery owner. He’s a university president. Weary of battling drinking on campus during his tenure as president of Middlebury College, John McCardell Jr. penned a column in The New York Times assailing  the 21-year-old drinking age as “bad social policy and terrible law.” “Right now we’re in an impossible position (on college campuses). Why should we be expected to enforce a law that’s ignored by 70 percent of students before they even come (to college)?” McCardell, now president of the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, told CNN this week. “It’s taking place behind closed doors, where it’s much more dangerous. It’s unsupervised,” he said. “It’s out of step with social reality.” CNN Opinion: Get real, lower drinking age to 19 Instead, he argues, colleges should be given the chance to educate students on how to drink responsibly, within campus boundaries and out in the open. In 2008 McCardell recruited more than 130 college presidents to sign the Amethyst Initiative, which pushed for a new federal transportation bill that wouldn’t penalize states for setting drinking ages under 21. He said he and other college presidents were set to testify before Congress that fall when the economy tanked and legislators’ priorities turned elsewhere. “We missed our moment,” he said. Lawmakers in a handful of states have proposed lowering the drinking age from 21 to 18, but none have gained traction so far. Experts say lowering the drinking age remains a tough sell to politicians worried about re-election. A 2007 Gallup poll found that 77% of Americans opposed lowering the drinking age in all states to 18. “There isn’t much appetite to change something that appears to be working,” said Martinic of ICAP. “It’s not a very popular issue and it could potentially be damaging to a politician to advocate for a lower age, because nobody wants more traffic accidents. It’s pretty much a no go.” But McCardell is not giving up. He believes legal limits for drinking should be set by the states, not the federal government. And he proposes that American teens be eligible for an alcohol permit – not unlike a driver’s license – upon turning 18, graduating from high school and completing an alcohol-education course. They would need the permit to buy beer, wine or liquor, and the state could revoke the permit for those convicted of alcohol-related offenses such as drunk driving.",7770,Brandon Griggs,0.095,0.84,0.065,-0.9901
114,114,01/04/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/01/us/transgender-questions-leelah/index.html,"The transgender life: What to know, say and understand",US,CNN,"The weekend suicide of a transgender teen in Ohio sparked an intensely emotional reaction across social media which shows no sign of letting up. Born as Josh Alcorn, the teen signed an online suicide note as Leelah. Leelah explained that she always felt like a girl and wanted her parents to accept that. They did not, mother Carla Alcorn told CNN, for religious reasons. Though she loved her child, the mother struggled to wrap her mind around what transgender means. “The only way I will rest in peace is if one day transgender people aren’t treated the way I was, they’re treated like humans, with valid feelings and human rights,” Leelah pleaded in her note. “My death needs to be counted.” There is more information than ever about transgender people – from new research to a freshly written book of personal essays, “Trans Bodies, Trans Selves” to the critically acclaimed new Amazon series “Transparent.” What is transgender? Transgender is an umbrella term for people whose gender identity, expression or behavior does not conform to the sex they were assigned at birth, according to American Psychological Association, which recently posted a Q&A on the topic. Sex is different from gender: Sex refers to genitalia, and gender is the cultural construct society has created to differentiate between men and women. Transgender also gets confused with sexual orientation. Just because someone is transgender doesn’t mean they are gay, lesbian or bisexual. It’s also important to know the difference between transgender people and transsexuals. Transsexuals alter or want to change their bodies by using hormones, surgery or other means to come more in line with the gender with which they associate, the association says. Not all transgender people want to change their bodies. Although it may seem like a relatively new topic, transgender people have been documented since antiquity in many cultures around the world. A transgender person has told you they are transgender. What’s the first thing you should say? Some experts say you should try this: “I love you and support you.” That first reaction from a friend or family member whose judgment matters is critical, said Aidan Key, the founder of the family education and support organization Gender Diversity in Washington. “Consider that they’re facing many other challenges, and you can offer a place where they can simply be accepted, a place without struggle.” Chances are very good it’s taken a tremendous amount of courage for your friend or family member to come to you. Elizabeth Crankshaw, who was born a male but identifies as a woman, said it’s also OK to “say you don’t understand, because how could you? You’d have to be trans to get it.” Crankshaw grew up in the 1970s when there was no commonly parsed language about being transgender. She was married and came out first to her ex-wife and then to her sister. “It was terrifying. I had so much anxiety,” she recalled. “You have to think of the worst things that could happen. How will my employer will react? Will I lose my job? Will my co-workers treat me differently?” If a transgender person is renting a home, she added, they could be afraid of backlash from a landlord. If you feel the urge to ask a transgender person whether they’ve physically changed their genitalia, think twice. There’s no steadfast rule on this, say transgender people and experts who study gender and sexual identity issues. This is where sensitivity and some common sense come in, and generally it’s best to not ask this question. Put yourself in their shoes. Would you want them to ask you about your body’s most private parts? As Matt Kailey writes on his highly read blog, Tranifesto, transgender people should be afforded the same respect as anyone. Their bodies are their own. “Trans people are not public property,” he writes. “Touching something on a person to see if it is ‘real’ or asking personal questions about a person’s body or sex life is inappropriate – unless the person has invited you to ‘ask me anything.’ Otherwise, do not do or say anything that you would not do or say to anyone else.” Is it all right to ask, ‘When did you know you were transgender?’ Don’t ask this question. Instead, try directing the question at yourself, advises Crankshaw. When did you know you were a girl or a boy? Can you pinpoint that as a choice you made, or did it happen subconsciously? “Transgender people knew just the same as you,” said Key. “The difference is that we didn’t have the language to describe it.” The pronoun conundrum: What is appropriate? Most transgender people want to be referred to by the pronoun of the gender with which they identify. “This is the shortest, simplest way to say, ‘I see you; I acknowledge you,’ ” Key said. If you don’t always get it right, don’t freak out. Don’t make big deal of it, Kailey writes on Tranifesto. When Ryan Cassata, a transgender 21-year-old, told his mother years ago that he felt like a boy rather than a girl, she immediately showed him love and acceptance. But it took practice for Fran Cassata to call him the new name – Ryan – that he wanted. She laughs, recalling the experience. “I kept using ‘she’ and then I finally said to him, ‘Well, you try to call me by a different name. Don’t call me Mom anymore. You can call me ‘Your Highness.’ ” Mother and son navigated a very difficult experience with humor, a method she encourages. How do you parent a child who identifies as transgender? Ryan Cassata is now a singer who performs and travels around the country giving speeches about his experience. There are usually parents in the audience who are just beginning to go through what he and his mom did years ago. “I understand that it can feel really hard,” Fran Cassata said. “But I ask them to take some time to think about whether it is really, really that hard.” At first, parents might go through a mourning period because they are grieving the loss of a son or daughter – the child’s assigned gender. “For me it didn’t last very long because I realized Ryan was still the same person,” she said. “Your child is still your child. They still have the same laugh; their favorite color and foods are the same. It’s all the same love. It’s just now your daughter is your son or your son is your daughter.” Try to resist reacting overly emotionally, say parents of transgender children. Take some time and get information. Check out college English professor Jennifer Finney Boylan’s book “Stuck in the Middle with You: Parenthood in Three Genders.” Finney Boylan transitioned from male to female. Experts also point to the Family Acceptance Project at San Francisco State University, which offers support and a wealth of information to help keep families talking and together. Clinical social worker Caitlin Ryan directs the project, which in the past 14 years has trained more than 60,000 families, mental health providers and clergy in the United States, China and some Latin American countries. Could it be a phase? Key works with a lot of families and children, especially elementary school students who are just beginning to express a gender that is different from the one assigned to them at birth. Some parents will be inclined to ask, “Is this a phase?” She advises parents to give themselves permission to think of it as a phase if it helps them. “What if it is a phase? Take that question further,” she said. “Don’t we as parents want our children to be able to explore and learn?” A parent should be concerned with sending an immediate message to their child that they accept them. The phase question is tied, of course, to “What if my child changes his or her mind?” “Well, OK, then they do!” said Key. “Give them that freedom.” Do you think your religious beliefs don’t allow you to accept transgender people? This is a far more complex discussion than can be had in this story. But Key has some insight. He was raised in a fundamentalist Christian household. His mother happened to adore him, he said, and he always felt accepted. Leelah Alcorn said in her suicide note that she felt rejection from her Christian parents. A transgender person may also struggle when it comes to religion: If they believe, they may fear that their God will ultimately reject them. Key works with families of various religious beliefs who have a transgender relative. “I always tell them to start with the core values of a religion: love and acceptance and nonjudgment,” said Key. “There may be an inclination to go talk to a pastor or some other leader.” Rethink doing that, he said. A person who is not the child’s parent probably isn’t going to have the same bond or the same level of concern, said Key.  And it could feel like a scary betrayal to a child if you go to another adult that they’ve not consented to knowing about their transgender identity. Believe in your connection with your child, and that will resonate with him or her. How hard can it be to navigate this world as a transgender person? Beyond emotional challenges and questions of self, a transgender person has to live in a society that is defined by “male”  and “female.” In 2013, for example, CNN wrote about a transgender first-grader who was born a boy but identified as a girl. The child’s parents won a long legal battle for their child to use the girls’ restroom at her Colorado elementary school. Transgender first-grader wins right to use school’s female bathroom The Colorado Rights Division said that keeping Coy Mathis, born with male genitalia, from using the girls’ bathroom created “an environment that is objectively and subjectively hostile, intimidating or offensive.” It was a first-of-its-kind ruling in the country regarding transgender students’ rights. That sounded like progress to Fran Cassata. When Ryan Cassata was in school less than a decade ago, he was told he could not use the boys’ or girls’ bathroom but had to go to a nurse’s station to sign in, his mother said. He always signed the name “Ryan.” One day the nurse told him that he couldn’t go to the bathroom unless he signed his birth name, Fran Cassata recounted. So the teen went to principal, who told the nurse that the teenager could say he was Superman, just let him take care of business. “You hope there are kind people your child will encounter,” she said. “You hope there are people who help them rather than ridicule them.” But there will be people like that nurse. There will be people far worse. “Just be a parent,” she said. “Trust that they can handle themselves, and give them your strength when they need you.”",10556,Ashley Fantz,0.052,0.845,0.103,0.9982
115,115,01/03/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/02/us/skid-row-cop/index.html,On patrol with Skid Row’s ‘angel cop’,US,CNN,"Somebody else might walk by without looking at the painfully thin crackhead curled on the sidewalk in the fetal position. Or nudge her with a foot. Not Deon Joseph. This muscular black man with arms thick as hams leans over and gently shakes the woman’s bony shoulder. He wants to make contact, ensure that she is still breathing. “How you doing today?” She curses him, still very much alive. “Have a good day, ma’am,” he replies, moving on down the line of dazed people and overstuffed shopping carts outside the Union Rescue Mission. It’s just another day in the life of a man shopkeepers and residents of the nation’s last true Skid Row call the “Sheriff of Skidberry.” Joseph is senior lead officer for the Los Angeles Police Department, and Skid Row has been his beat for the past 17 years. He prefers foot patrol; it is more intimate. Despite the open drug dealing, piles of trash and omnipresent aroma of urine, feces and burning crack and weed, he has found a community here. These are his people. He used to make a lot of arrests, but these days he spends most of his time just talking to people and handing out donated hygiene kits – toothpaste, soap, deodorant, lotion and shaving cream – and fliers that explain how to apply for housing vouchers.  He leads self-defense classes for homeless women, events he calls “Ladies’ Night.” He tweets crime prevention tips and offers up anecdotes on Facebook. He gives out his email address and cell phone number. And then he returns the calls. And so, he knows nearly everybody – The Hurricane, Bow Leg, Slow Bucket, Thick ‘n’ Juicy – and they know him, too. Some like him, some don’t. Most respect him. Some say he’s their angel watching over them. Nearly two decades on some of the nation’s poorest, nastiest streets haven’t stripped this beat cop of his humanity. He sports a shiny bald pate and kind, expressive eyes. But should the situation call for it, he can turn fierce and scary-looking in a heartbeat. He is not jaded or cynical, and he doesn’t view the world as LAPD blue against everybody else. He is a man of deep, abiding Christian faith, and he considers Skid Row his mission in life.  He says he wouldn’t dream of working anywhere else. These are tense times for police and the policed. Everybody’s talking about white cops shooting black kids; hundreds show up in small towns and big cities for “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” protests. Joseph has never fired his gun and hopes he never has to. In the one-square mile marked by a mural that announces “Skid Row, pop. Too Many,” he is a walking, talking public service announcement for the upside of community-based policing. When homeless addicts call him by his first name, Officer Joseph doesn’t  feel dissed. He’s honored. “I feel respect when they call me by my first name,” he explains, “and I show them respect by calling them sir or ma’am.” In this neighborhood, 2,000 people sleep on the streets at night, by Joseph’s estimate. He’s seeing a lot of new faces lately as it gets harder legally to commit somebody to mental health facilities, while the prisons and jails are letting inmates out early to ease overcrowding. With nowhere else to go, many head to Skid Row, he says. Not long ago, Skid Row was easy to ignore, a pocket of misery on the outskirts of a crumbling city shell nobody visited. But after two decades of downtown development, there are finally neighbors to bear witness. What happens when 50,000 people move next door to Skid Row? The dumping ground becomes hot property. And solving homelessness becomes a priority. The next few years could bring big changes. But Joseph and others say Skid Row doesn’t need any more handouts. It has plenty of food and clothing. What Skid Row needs, they say, is affordable housing – and lots of it. As much as they’d like to, city leaders can’t undo a century of bad urban policy overnight. But there are calls from Mayor Eric Garcetti and other leaders to end homelessness, especially on Skid Row, by 2015. These are the same words Joseph heard from their predecessors a decade ago. Little happened then, and even as 2015 begins, the deadline has been officially pushed back to 2016. Joseph believes it’s time to stop playing politics with Skid Row. The stakes – literally life and death – are too high. “I believe the extremes of both ideologies are what created Skid Row,” Joseph says. “By that, I mean the extreme right believes in NIMBYism – not in my back yard. We’ll shove all our problems into downtown LA and come down once a month and throw food and clothes at them and feel good about ourselves. “And then the extreme left truly believes that because they’re poor, black, Hispanic, whatever, because they’re of poorer socioeconomic status, that we as law enforcement should just leave them alone. They really believe we should be hands off. And those two ideologies created what we’re dealing with on Skid Row.” Seventeen years have shown him that Skid Row isn’t going anywhere. “But don’t build another one.” Sliding down The Nickel L.A.’s Skid Row is the undisputed Homeless Capital of the United States and just a short stroll from the power chambers of City Hall and the city’s gleaming office towers, trendy bistros and overpriced residential lofts. To get from the halls of glitz to the corner of grit and despair, just follow Fifth Street. Start at the fancy Biltmore Hotel, scene of many a political victory speech. Cross the park over to Broadway, which is getting a facelift of planters and lights; and then past Spring, which is clogged with hipsters. Once you hit Los Angeles Street, you’ve arrived in Skid Row. The trek is known as “sliding down The Nickel.” On foot, it takes 15 minutes, tops. But if you use the term metaphorically, the slide can consume a lifetime and land you in a pauper’s grave. I asked Joseph to show me his Skid Row and accompanied him on patrol in mid-September. I shadowed him on a Saturday, a weekday and the following Saturday night. Each tour had a different vibe. The day shifts seemed more like a Fellini street festival. But Skid Row turns scary after dark. It was not a good place to be a stranger, especially a well-dressed, well-fed, blond female stranger. People lurch down the streets like zombies. They are half-dressed with hair uncombed and matted, missing eyes and teeth, feet bare, their soles blackened. It’s a sea of sunken faces with eyes gleaming with insanity, drugs or both. Those who are missing limbs get around on wheelchairs and jerry-rigged devices made from wagons, tricycles and carts. While I watched, a woman sitting on the pavement shot heroin between her toes and then slathered her feet with moisturizer from a donated hygiene kit. She was oblivious to my presence and pretty much everything else. Skid Row appears on no official city map. The boundaries were plotted in a 2006 court decision: Third Street on the north, Seventh Street on the south, Alameda Street to the east and Main Street to the west. Joseph’s beat includes two of Skid Row’s worst blocks: San Pedro and San Julian streets, between Fifth and Sixth, where the concentration of missions and other services draws the most desperate. “You cannot separate the blight and crap that’s out here from death,” Joseph says as we walk past one homeless person after another, huddled in mounds of donated clothes piled into shopping carts. Some find a measure of privacy in tents they construct by draping tarps over shopping carts. Once under cover, a person can drink, drug, sleep, have sex and even die in peace. “One time I saw a guy sitting on a pile of trash and I saw a hand, a white hand. I thought it was a mannequin,” Joseph recalls. “It wasn’t a mannequin. It was a dead woman. He didn’t realize he was sitting on top of a dead woman, eating donated food.” I think about this story on another day, while we’re on patrol in his car. A hand rises up from under one of those ubiquitous blue tarps. It’s more of a salute than a wave. A woman, recognizing Joseph, is sending up a signal: “It’s all good.” It isn’t always. Joseph tells the story of a 6-foot-4 addict who arrived on Skid Row 275 pounds. A year or so later, Joseph barely recognized the man when he nearly tripped over him on the sidewalk. He was down to 85 pounds. “I thought he was dead,” Joseph said. “I pulled his sleeve and maggots and flies came out. He’d been lying there for a while. There were dozens of people around and nobody called an ambulance for him, nobody. “I looked at this guy and I said, ‘Hey, are you OK?’ And he says, ‘Joseph, just leave me be. Let me die. I got two days left on this Earth, so just let me die right here.’ “And I said ‘Uh-uh, you’re not dying on my block.’ I called an ambulance for him. They took him to the hospital. He died five days later, but at least he died with some damn dignity.” It’s hard to tell what’s trash here and what isn’t, who’s living and who’s dying. Joseph points to what looks like mounds of dirty laundry, piled up on the sidewalk. “This is where people’s good intentions go in Skid Row,” he says. “People donate clothes, and they’re thrown in the street. People urinate, defecate in the street. Nobody cleans it up. “It creates a really toxic environment. Now when I say ‘toxic,’ we have staph, we have MRSA, we have HIV, we have tuberculosis, we have all these things. It’s like a giant petri dish.” I stop to feed the parking meter with a credit card. A breeze is blowing, and I brush my hair back from my face. “See what you did there?” says Joseph’s partner, Danny Reedy. “You just touched your face. We don’t do that after we touch things here.” ‘A golden moment’ L.A.’s is essentially the last true Skid Row in the nation. It has the highest concentration of homeless in the country, according to a recent report by an ad hoc committee calling itself Plan for Hope. San Francisco has the Tenderloin District, but it is tiny by comparison. As mayor, Gavin Newsom led an aggressive campaign to find subsidized housing and reunite homeless residents with their families. Seattle’s homeless have been pushed to the grassy hills overlooking Interstate 5; its former Skid Row streets are dotted with trendy bistros and galleries. And in New York, The Bowery has become so gentrified that it now boasts a Whole Foods Market. “Gentrification” is a dirty word along Skid Row.  But it’s inevitable. It’s already happening in the blocks nearby, pushing back on Skid Row’s Main  Street boundary. Skid Row has its own economic engine – and it’s not crack cocaine or the handmade soy soaps sold in the gift shop of the Downtown Women’s Center. Some $54 million is pumped each year into Skid Row’s 107 charities that provide services to the homeless, according to a report released in September by Plan for Hope. By comparison, the city of Los Angeles earmarked the same amount – $54 million – for the arts in its 2014 budget. Developer Tom Gilmore, who converted old bank and office buildings into residential lofts, sparking the downtown development renaissance, says Los Angeles is “the last city in America to develop its urban center.” It has taken two decades to reverse the exodus to the suburbs and bring people back downtown. Skid Row didn’t spring up by accident, he adds. It’s the result of a century of neglect and poor urban policy. A decision in the 1970s to centralize services for the poor on Skid Row turned it into a dumping ground for every social ill imaginable. Gilmore thinks the city has arrived at  “a golden moment” to do something about homelessness. “There’s a new consciousness that is extremely sensitive to the needs of the homeless,” Gilmore said. “Does that mean they accept the notion of Skid Row? No, no, no because Skid Row is a travesty as a construct. It’s a toxic environment for the homeless.” “Nobody is going to raise up from there,” he says with a shake of his head. “It has to be unwound because it’s this Gordian knot of social neglect.” As someone who works Skid Row’s streets every weekend, Joseph agrees. “Skid Row is a toxic petri dish that thwarts any form of recovery,” he says. “We have beer barons selling singles for $2, right outside AA meetings.” He has arrested one of the more notorious beer barons several times, but the man usually returns after spending just a few hours in jail. Even an injunction didn’t stop him, and now he’s threatening to sue Joseph, alleging “police harassment.” Follow any conversation about Skid Row long enough, and it always comes down to the need for more affordable housing. This is especially difficult in Los Angeles, which is among the most expensive housing markets in the nation. It is not unusual for working people to spend half their income putting a roof over their heads. Next year’s $1.1 trillion federal spending bill includes more than $2 billion for subsidized housing, according to the National Alliance to End Homelessness. The question, of course, is how much of that will reach Los Angeles, or Skid Row? Meanwhile, private, for-profit development of Skid Row is inevitable, Gilmore says. But he is quick to add that the homeless population isn’t going anywhere – not as long as the missions and other services for the poor are located there. It’s a big point on which the developer and the beat cop can agree. The services can’t be dismantled, but they can and should be decentralized. Other parts of the city, they say, need to step up and share responsibility. Nationally, chronic homelessness is down slightly more than 20%. But not on Skid Row. Here, the numbers are going up. How much? The answer should come soon. The last official headcount cited in the Plan for Hope report found about 1,300 people living outdoors in the 50-block area designated as Skid Row. Estimates last summer ranged around 1,500. By December, Joseph’s best guess – and the LAPD’s – was 1,900 to 2,000. He had just finished a weeklong outreach program under the banner of Operation Healthy Streets. The program has replaced the harsher tactics that included criminalizing outdoor camping and arresting everyone in sight during massive sweeps. Now police work in small groups that include county mental health workers and volunteers. They ask the homeless what they need and refer them to programs and places that can help. Four times a year, they pressure-wash the sidewalks and haul away the trash – 3.5 tons of it during a weeklong sweep in the fall. That included 184 needles and syringes, 63 razor blades and seven knives. Sanitation workers hosed urine and feces from hundreds of curbs, corners and building fronts. Eighty homeless people were treated for scabies, open wounds and other maladies. Twenty-seven were referred to county mental health services. Four were sent to detox. It is more hands-on than tossing loaves of stale bread and discarded Hello Kitty T-shirts at the homeless. Downtown loft dweller Betsy Starman is now among the volunteers. Her involvement began in the summer, when she posted to a Facebook group called DTLA about a woman squatting at Fifth and Hill streets. The woman muttered and clawed at herself, and her skin was covered with sores. She had fashioned a diaper from newspapers. She didn’t want anyone’s help. Joseph saw Starman’s post and approached the woman with a box of adult diapers. But she didn’t want his help, either. There was little he could do for her. But he and Starman started talking, and she attended a 10-week Citizens Police Academy, graduating in November. Operation Healthy Streets reflected a big change in direction. Finally, the city, the county and some of downtown L.A.’s 50,000 new residents are  working together. “Deon Joseph was the only one talking about the homeless, the mentally ill, and the addicted that I could hear,” Starman said. “We have many who pontificate and pretend they do things and have their photo ops, but Officer Joseph is not like that. “He’s real,” she added. “It gave hope to me, and it gave hope to the entire city. It started a movement, and it is still moving. Many of us could not have become involved or had any hope whatsoever without him.” ‘Swagger! Swagger! Swagger!’ On the second day I shadowed him, Joseph had a trunk-load of hygiene kits in his patrol car. He drove to Gladys Street Park, where people crowded around him, hands outstretched, clamoring for “Swagger!” It’s an especially potent deodorant and body spray by Right Guard. But Swagger can only cover up the inevitable truth for so long. The place smells like old tennis shoes that have been urinated on by 1,000 people with body odor. Since it hardly ever rains, the pungent aroma of urine and excrement never really washes away. It takes a while to scrub Eau d’Skid Row from your clothes, your hair and your nostrils. Somehow Joseph has gotten used to it. He wears black rubber gloves everywhere and chews a lot of gum. He grew up in Long Beach during the Rodney King era, when distrust of the LAPD fueled racial tensions and devastating riots. Like his friends, he was no fan of the po-po. So nobody was more surprised than Joseph himself when he signed up for the Los Angeles Police Academy. “I needed a job,” he says. As a rookie, Joseph prayed he wouldn’t be assigned here. He liked the hip, beachy vibe of Venice, where he trained. But when the permanent postings came out, Joseph wondered whether he had prayed hard enough. Driving to Skid Row on his first day of work, Joseph cruised up the 110 freeway, glimpsed the gleaming skyline and thought, “Look at that pretty picture. This can’t be all bad.” He took the downtown exit, relieved to see people on the sidewalks in suits and ties. And then he crossed Spring Street. “It was if I tripped and fell into Dante’s Inferno. And I couldn’t believe how fast it happened. I wasn’t prepared for it.” He drove another block. It only got worse. “The smell, it hits you as soon as you cross Los Angeles Street. I felt nauseous.” Maybe a police station would serve as an anchor of sanity in the middle of this freak show? “As soon as I got closer to the station, I saw half-naked women running around urinating on the sidewalk, guys urinating on the sidewalk, people smoking crack. I saw a patrol car and two feet away a guy was injecting himself with heroin. Another person was smoking crack and a fight broke out. An officer couldn’t stop it. “And I’m going, ‘Oh my God, I’ve got to get out off these streets and into the station.’ In there, it was worse because on the bench we had addicts and dealers and mentally ill individuals. And the mentally ill individuals were yelling all sorts of things.” He had one thing on his mind: “Oh man, I surely gotta escape.” After a while, though, “my DNA kicked in.” That DNA includes regular church attendance and parents who raised 41 foster kids – 17 of them while he was living at home. “My mom had a special love for children. I saw her heal those kids,” he said. His parents grew up poor in Louisiana during the Jim Crow era in the South. His great-grandfather was killed by a 16-year-old white kid, Joseph said, simply because he wouldn’t get out of the street. The shooter went on to become the sheriff. Joseph’s father was bitter about the injustice and seemed destined to a life of crime. But a man he tried to rob turned out to be a preacher, Joseph recounted. “Put that gun down, boy,” the man said. “You’re not going to jail today, but I want to see you in church.” It changed his life. He moved to California, supported his family at first by collecting and recycling cans. He started a construction company and found success. He hired ex-convicts and veterans and treated them well. His mother fed the homeless. They taught their children to help others rather than judge them, and to love and embrace their color and their culture. Joseph has experienced racism in his lifetime, but not in the same way his father did. When he was younger, a white kid at a burger joint put staples in his meal. Fliers distributed around Skid Row attacked him as an “Uncle Tom.” But when a colleague filed a racial discrimination suit against his sergeant and the LAPD, Joseph took the witness stand and said it wasn’t true. “This is what I have to do,” he says of his career on Skid Row. “I can go anywhere in this department. There are 17 divisions. I can go back to Venice, sip on lattes, chase celebrities in Hollywood. I can go anywhere. I can leave at any time. I choose to be here. I want to help these people. It’s in my heart to help these people.” Taking inventory “Helping these people’ has gotten complicated, as I learned on my final ride with Deon Joseph. Years of court battles have determined what cops can and can’t do on Skid Row. The days of declaring street camping illegal and making mass arrests are over. No more hook ‘em and book ‘em. Police can no longer just sweep what looks like junk off the streets. That junk might be somebody’s only possessions in the world, the courts have ruled. It is harder than ever to obtain an involuntary commitment against someone who might be dangerous. Joseph vented his frustration this past summer in an open letter published in the Downtown News. It’s how he caught my eye. Here was an LAPD cop calling out the city for ignoring Skid Row. That was unusual enough. But then he didn’t get in trouble with the brass. That was extraordinary. He called Skid Row “an open air mental asylum.” He said the city was on the brink of an epic meltdown, and there wasn’t much he, or the LAPD, could do about it. “When it comes to policing Skid Row, it seems as if my fellow officers and I are keeping our fingers in the cracks of a dam to keep it from breaking,” he wrote. “Though many people may not realize it, we are in the throes of a mental health state of emergency.” He said police have to wait until something bad happens before they can do anything. “Though many times this is understandable from a legal and public safety standpoint,” he wrote, “it remains in my opinion one of the great wrongs in our society.” Joseph has appeared in several documentaries and starred in a handful of YouTube videos. In the most controversial, he pleads with do-gooders not to simply hand out food and clothes on Skid Row. It’s not that he’s anti-charity. Far from it. But bottomless freebies keep people out of the missions and away from services that can actually help them. By donating, well-intended people become part of an enabler economy based on the hustle. “Nobody ever goes hungry on Skid Row,” Joseph says, and it’s true, only the deeply addicted get scary-thin. Many of the others could even stand to lose a few pounds. Yet somehow Joseph’s message was twisted into “Don’t give to the homeless,” which is not at all what he meant. He has an uncanny ability to strike a nerve. He gets into his share of controversies. But he’s hard to ignore. Among his critics is General Jeff Page, with the Los Angeles Community Action Network, a homeless advocacy group. General Jeff, as he’s known around Skid Row, is a hip-hop impresario who runs a three-way basketball league in one of Skid Row’s parks. He and Joseph used to be friends. Neither will say what caused the falling out.  General Jeff says Joseph is a media hound who steals his group’s ideas and takes credit for them. He calls him a phony and points out that the streets on Joseph’s foot beat are among the city’s messiest. Joseph refers to his critics as “my detractors” and won’t get in a tit-for-tat with them. It all sounds like a high school sandlot beef. Also on his personal list of “detractors” is the ACLU. The civil rights lawyers objected in court to how the LAPD was handling Skid Row with massive sweeps and arrests. Although no longer a fan of the tactic, Joseph says it got results. “We used small laws to stop bigger things from happening,” he said. “It worked. The tents came down. They were allowed to sleep until 9 o’clock. There wasn’t a lot of garbage on the sidewalk. They didn’t have a lot of shopping carts to hide behind. They couldn’t sit on the sidewalk and get comfortable in their own destruction.” He says the numbers back him up. When the city was carrying out sweeps and arresting people, crime on Skid Row dropped 40%. In 2005, 93 people died in Skid Row’s shelters, and 18 on the streets. But by 2009, only five of the 63 deaths occurred on the streets. The ACLU won a second decision in 2011 that set further limits on what police could do. The suit alleged that the LAPD was harassing the people of Skid Row by seizing their tents and other property. “They were able to sell that we were hassling people,” Joseph says. “If I wasn’t a cop, I would have believed it, too.” The courts have ruled that on Skid Row, a tent is a homeless person’s castle; what might appear to be trash is actually personal property. It’s what cut short our final tour of Skid Row. “It’s getting thick out there,” Joseph advised at roll call as the swing shift began at Central Station. It was Saturday night, and the locals seemed primed for fighting. Yet we didn’t last half an hour on the streets. Joseph had to weigh whether to make an arrest or keep going. An arrest entails paperwork and hours of inventory. If nobody is bleeding, is it really worth it? A thin black man with droopy jeans was spreading perfume bottles, combs, mirrors and makeup on a blanket on the sidewalk. It’s considered illegal vending. He had several cartons with him, and two overflowing shopping carts. The crime might seem petty to an outsider, Joseph explained, but the guy keeps coming back, each time with more trinkets. It’s like he’s laying down a challenge, seeing how far he can take it. Joseph decided he’d seen enough. He ran the man’s name through the computer in his patrol car and found two arrest warrants out of Long Beach. The man was wanted for assault. Bingo! He placed the man under arrest, and Joseph and two other officers hauled his trinkets back to the station and spent the next four hours cataloging the man’s personal possessions – putting labels and tags on each perfume bottle, hair clip and tube of mascara. Joseph’s shift came to a close before he could return to the streets. He gathered up his gym bag and walked to his car, parked in a lot behind the station. On the way out, he spotted an inebriated man lurching along Wall Street. The man stopped, unzipped and proceeded to relieve himself. “Please sir,” Joseph says, “do not urinate on my police station.” Where the daily battle is so huge, it’s the little things that matter.",26455,Ann O'Neill,0.092,0.834,0.074,-0.9987

North Korea has its Internet back. And rock and roll says goodbye to an iconic voice. It’s Tuesday and here are the 5 things to know for your New Day 1.  NYPD COP KILLINGS Turning blue: New York Mayor Bill de Blasio is catching plenty of heat in the aftermath of the execution-style killings of two of the city’s cops over the weekend. Critics – including those in the police force – accuse him of stoking an anti-police fervor that contributed to the deaths of officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos. He came into office promising police reform. Now he’s trying to cool tensions after encouraging people to protest the killings of Michael Brown and Eric Garner, two unarmed African-American men, at the hands of white police officers. Neither officer was charged. He said the murders this weekend were “an attack on all of us” and called for a hiatus from the protests. More on this story. 2.  MILWAUKEE POLICE SHOOTING No charges here: A district attorney in Wisconsin has decided against filing charges against a police officer who fatally shot a mentally ill man more than a dozen times in Milwaukee. The officer, Christopher Manney, killed Dontre Hamilton during a confrontation in April. The officer says he opened fire when Hamilton grabbed his baton and struck him with it. Manney has since been fired for not following protocols, but he will not be charged. As in the Brown and Garner cases, Hamilton was black and Manney is white. The U.S. Department of Justice will review the case. More on this story. 3.  NORTH KOREA INTERNET Message sent?: North Korea’s Internet appears to be back up after a more than nine-hour outage, according to a company that monitors such things. The disruption came in the midst of an escalating war of words between the United States and North Korea over a massive cyberattack on Sony Pictures. The United States blames North Korea for the Sony hack; North Korea denies it was involved. It’s not clear what caused the outage, but it brought down major websites that are hosted inside the country. There were no problems accessing pro-Pyongyang pages that have servers elsewhere, the South Korean news agency Yonhap reported. More on this story. 4.  HOLIDAY TRAVEL WEATHER Christmas countdown: Getting to grandma’s house could be a bit sloppy the next two days, especially in the eastern third of the country. Rain, storms, wind and even a little snow is predicted, forecasters say. Severe storms, damaging winds, large hail and possibly isolated tornadoes are predicted in the Deep South. Plenty of rain will douse the region. The foul weather could mean airport delays up and down the East Coast. The Northwest can expect lots of moisture too, which could turn to snow as it heads toward the Midwest later in the week. More on this story. 5.

Abdel Mouin told CNN by phone from Tripoli that the family was notified by his lawyer in the United States that al Libi, whose real name was Nazih al-Ruqaii, died in a hospital Friday evening. The 50-year-old native of Libya was accused of playing a role in the 1998 U.S. Embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania. The two bombings killed 224 people, including 12 Americans, and injured thousands more. A document filed in court Saturday by the Department of Justice said al Libi died after his already poor health suddenly worsened. On Wednesday, the letter filed with the judge presiding over the trial said, he “was taken from the Metropolitan Correctional Center to a New York hospital due to sudden complications arising out of his long-standing medical problems.” Despite the care provided at the hospital, it said, his condition deteriorated rapidly and he passed away Friday evening. “We understand that, in addition to his counsel, an Imam was with (al Libi) at the hospital and that appropriate arrangements are being made with his family,” the letter said. Mouin told CNN his father’s health had deteriorated since U.S. Army Delta Force soldiers snatched him from outside his family home in Tripoli in October 2013. Mouin said his father, who suffered from advanced hepatitis C, had been in a hospital in a coma before his death. He said his father had also developed liver cancer since his capture. The family holds the U.S. government “fully responsible” for what happened to the man they call al-Ruqaii, Mouin said. Mouin earlier had said that the family had urged the U.S. authorities to allow them to visit al Libi, but that those requests had been denied. Al Libi was indicted in 2001 by the federal court in the Southern District of New York on charges of conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals, murder, destruction of American buildings and government property and destruction of national defense utilities of the United States. More than a decade later, the top U.S. terror suspect was captured on the street in front of his home as he returned in his car from morning prayers. He was then held on a U.S. Navy ship for several days – where he was questioned by members of a high-value detainee interrogation team – before being taken to New York. When he appeared in federal court in New York, he pleaded not guilty to terrorism charges brought against him and told the judge he played no role in the 1998 attacks. His wife said at the time of his capture that he was no longer a member of al Qaeda, had been living a normal life and was seeking a job with the Libyan oil ministry.",2810,Jomana Karadsheh,0.146,0.803,0.051,-0.995
119,119,01/03/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/02/us/ferguson-interracial-couple/index.html,The crucible of Ferguson – and a family it changed,US,CNN,"For a while, Stefannie Wheat wished she could turn back the clock to a time before the hot August afternoon when Michael Brown’s body fell limp on Canfield Road. She grew frustrated and angry that her life was upended by the shooting death of an unarmed young black man at the hands of a white police officer  – and by everything that transpired in the aftermath. The demonstrations, the looting, the violence. The verbal venom hurled at her family and the way matters of race suddenly became front and center. Wheat faced confrontations with protesters who saw her as another white woman who didn’t understand. Never mind that she has been married to a black man for 18 years and that they adopted a black child. They took shots at her husband Ken, too – calling him a sellout, a black man siding with the white community, partly because the Wheats are good friends with Ferguson Mayor James Knowles. The couple had tried to raise their son Christopher in a home where race was invisible. “Ken and I don’t discuss race with Christopher,” Stefannie says. “We discuss character.” They largely succeeded in their plan. Until everything changed. Now as a new year begins, Stefannie realizes life in Ferguson can never be the same. And that she has been changed, too. “I didn’t have a choice,” she says one afternoon over a lunch of shrimp and pasta she prepared at her home just two blocks from the Ferguson Police Department, the staging ground for demonstrations. Behind her, the window pane in her back door is busted – broken by an intruder caught on the Wheats’ newly installed surveillance camera. Stefannie covered the shattered glass with plywood and painted it to look like a ribbon-tied Christmas gift. She suspects the intruder was someone linked to protesters who taunted her before. She cannot forgive such acts of violation but has also come to accept that perhaps the frustrations of Ferguson’s majority black community have long simmered beneath the surface. “We became blind to what was happening around us,” she says. A conversation with a friend made her rethink her frame of reference. So did watching her 10-year-old son deal with the ugly ways race can be made an issue. A boy at school asked him: “Why is your mother white?” “What does it matter?” Christopher responded. “A mom is a mom no matter what color they are. Why is your mom black?” Stefannie was proud of her son’s answer. But she has also come to realize that she can’t shield him from racial prejudice. “We’ve lived in our own circle for so long that we’ve forgotten it exists,” she says. “There’s apparently an underlying need for change in Ferguson. “I don’t want to go back to the normal we knew.” Preparing for the worst Hours before a grand jury would reveal its decision in the Michael Brown case, Stefannie almost hit a pedestrian on her way home from work. She’d been anxious ever since she learned that the announcement was going to be made at 8 p.m. on Monday, November 24. She felt like a soldier stepping onto the battlefield. More than three months had passed since the shooting. If the grand jury opted not to indict police Officer Darren Wilson, the fear was that Ferguson would again ignite with protests. The couple packed survival bags that included enough clothes and medications for three days. They discussed an emergency plan with Christopher and wrote down four contact numbers just in case he got separated from his parents in a melee. Stefannie kept thinking back to 1982 when her family had to abandon their home in Times Beach after the town, contaminated with dioxin, flooded and was deemed uninhabitable. She wondered if Christopher would one day store Ferguson in his memory the same way, in a compartment of unpleasantries. But she need not have worried. Her son packed his new favorite item of clothing: a bright Christmas t-shirt with the words “I Love Ferguson.” “We are the Wheat family,” he told his mother, “and we are Ferguson strong.” Stefannie smiled. But inside, she worried for Christopher’s safety. Not just on that night but beyond. One day soon he would be a young black man, like Michael Brown, and perhaps be affected by the color of his skin. Stefannie, 45, grew up in all-white Eureka, Missouri, and didn’t know anyone who was black until integration arrived and black students were bused to her high school in the early 1980s. But Ken, 47, felt the sting of racial prejudice and discrimination. He would do well in phone interviews for jobs but there was no return call once an employer saw that he was black. They’d married in 1997 and chose to move to Ferguson because they saw it as more racially tolerant than many other parts of St. Louis. She found it difficult to understand how Ferguson had now become synonymous with racial tension in America. She fried potatoes for dinner that night – comfort food, she thought, would do them well. Then, a half-hour before the courthouse announcement, she turned on the television. A local station was counting down the time to the decision as though it were New Year’s Eve and everyone was glued to their screens, waiting for the crystal ball to drop. Only it felt more like a ticking bomb. Stefannie could hear the protesters gathering on South Florissant Road, around the historic lamp posts decorated with holiday greens and reds and under the lit up “Seasons Greetings” banner. People were restless. She wondered: Would the crowd explode? She took solace in Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon’s declaration of a state of emergency. He had mobilized the National Guard and she felt safer knowing soldiers were on hand to stave off violence. She could hear the whirring of helicopters hovering in the sky. She thought it was surreal watching it unfold on television when it was happening just around the corner. But she and Ken dared not leave their house. “It’s 7:59,” yelled Christopher from his room. His parents thought – foolishly – that he wasn’t paying attention. The clock struck 8 and prosecuting attorney Robert McCollough began his news conference. Stefannie went outside and removed the “I Love Ferguson” sign from the front yard. She didn’t want to be a target. She left their American flag to flutter in the bitter cold. Inside, Ken unlocked the gun case – they had recently purchased a firearm for the first time in their lives – and checked to make sure the freshly installed surveillance camera was working. As McCollough spoke, the Wheats’ phone started ringing. Friends and family wanted to check on them. Christopher came into the living room to watch. “It’s too late to hide this from him,” Stefannie thought. “Now we are forced to explain it.” She was relieved when he opted to go back to his room to play with his iPad. At 8:27, the Wheats learned that Wilson would not face any charges. McCollough read out the details of what the state says happened on August 9. That day, Stefannie was at a car show with Christopher. Within minutes, photos and videos of Michael Brown filled her Facebook timeline. She could see the unarmed teenager’s blood flowing from his still-warm body. Now, the rage over his killing was consuming the protesters all over again. “No justice! No peace!” they chanted. They set police cars afire. They smashed store windows. Police fired tear gas to disperse the crowds. The National Guard never came. Stefannie learned from the news that the Little Caesar’s pizza place was burned to the ground. So was the storage facility on West Florissant Avenue. She wondered how many people had taken their valuables there for safekeeping only to have it all destroyed. “We will rebuild,” she told herself. Minutes felt like hours to the Wheats. A little after midnight, things had calmed down enough by their house and they decided to go to bed. “Why, tonight is just like any other night,” Christopher declared as he climbed into bed with his parents. He wanted to make his mom feel better. But Stefannie knew he was scared. Leaders ‘left our city to burn’ The next day, the family awoke to the destruction. They made their way to South Florissant Road and joined other volunteers to clean up the damage. Christopher felt bad for Michael Brown’s parents but could not understand the violent nature of some of the protesters. He helped his father sell “I Love Ferguson” merchandise to raise money for businesses that suffered. Over the next few weeks, Ferguson’s residents made art of the plywood on the buildings. They painted murals of peace, wrote messages of love and invoked their despair. They turned charred eyesores into beauty. “The rioters and looters sought to destroy our city,” Stefannie says. “What they did instead was confirm our solidarity.” She thought of how business owners must be suffering as she drove down South Florissant Road and West Florissant Avenue. She was upset, too, because she believed state and federal authorities failed Ferguson. “We’ve all been on this emotional roller coaster,” she says. “Governor Nixon and Attorney General (Eric) Holder promised protection through the National Guard but ignored our calls for help on the night of the grand jury decision. They left our city to burn.”’ She couldn’t understand how any act of violence could result in positive change. Sometimes, she seethed inside – enough to make her want to pick up a baseball bat and beat any protester who confronted her. She wanted to bash the windshields of their cars. One day, she was on the verge of doing just that when Christopher stopped her. He needed his mom, he told her. Everyone has a place on earth, he said. Some for good, some bad. The Wheat family, he said, needed to stay positive. “Look at the bright side, Mom,” he said. “You adopted me and now I get to live in Ferguson, make history and one day, my kids will read about this.” Stefannie asked him about the protesters’ claims that racism thrived in Ferguson. “I didn’t even know racial tension existed until now,” Christopher said to her. “I don’t get it, Mom. You’re white and I love you.” A different perspective The winter rain is unrelenting, as though Ferguson is drowning in its own tears. It’s late December, and on West Florissant Avenue, where the charred remains of buildings give off an apocalyptic vibe, business owners are trying to raise money to recuperate from heavy losses. Concrete jersey barriers still block the entrance to the Ferguson Police Department as they did the night of the grand jury decision. But the parking lot across the street, once teeming with protesters and media, lies vacant except for a solitary Toyota in front of the Subway sandwich shop. Some nearby eateries are starting to dismantle the protective plywood. Slowly, Ferguson residents are attempting to return to a daily routine. Frustrated that her life was being shaped by events that she could not control, Stefannie recently vented to a friend who is African-American. This was the closest to war she had ever come, she felt. Her friend did not condone the looting, vandalism and arson and even apologized for them. But he also told her this: “You’ve basically dealt with this since August. Imagine how some feel, having been judged their entire lives for something they also cannot control.” His words were like a needle bursting a balloon. She realized she had been blind to his perspective. In private online forums about Michael Brown’s case, she saw the racism that still exists. Someone had posted a photo of apes with a caption that read: “Ferguson protesters.” In early December, she saw on the news that a group of protesters had set out to walk the 120 miles from the spot where Brown died to the state Capitol in Jefferson City. Along the way, in the town of Rosebud, residents greeted protesters with fried chicken, watermelon and Confederate flags. They yelled racial epithets, and a bullet hit a bus that was driving alongside the marchers. Stefannie was taken aback. They were just as bad as the protesters who had looted and vandalized. “I have zero patience for racism, no matter who it comes from,” she says. As the days wore on, the spotlight shifted from Ferguson to New York, where a grand jury decided not to indict a white police officer in the killing of a black man, Eric Garner. Ferguson residents thought perhaps they could get back to the lives they were living before. Then came the shooting in neighboring Berkeley of another black 18-year-old. Police say a surveillance video shows Antonio Martin pointed his gun at a police officer and the killing was justified. But it didn’t matter. Protesters clashed with police, and Ferguson residents like the Wheats remain on edge, fearful that anger can at any moment turn to aggression again. “I get that people have grievances,” she says, “but don’t take it out on us.” She and Ken also believe it’s not enough for people to protest. They want everyone to work together to fix the things that are wrong. A few weeks ago, the Wheats took Christopher to Ferguson’s Christmas tree lighting. It was an annual community event that they never miss. Ken was wearing his “I Love Ferguson” T-shirt. “Do you want to buy a shirt?” he asked the protesters. “I have some dirty underwear for sale,” came the response from one. They questioned Ken’s “blackness” and called him crass names like “house n—-r.” Christopher heard it all. Stefannie wanted to shout out loud: “This is not a war between the races!” Instead, she led her husband to a spot between the protesters and the “I Love Ferguson” booth – and kissed him. It was her way of telling the world that Ferguson, known as the “hidden gem” of Missouri’s North County, could rise from the ashes and shine brighter than ever.",13633,Moni Basu,0.12,0.782,0.098,-0.9961

No, Mario Gomez called 911 to report something far more sinister and ghastly: His brother had just cut off their mother’s head with an ax. Responding deputies found the decapitated body of 48-year-old Maria Suarez Cassagne alongside garbage cans outside of the Tampa-area home, according to the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office. Her head was inside one of them. Gomez told the authorities that his younger brother, Christian Gomez, had fled the scene, but he didn’t make it too far. The Sheriff’s Office said it found the 23-year-old some 30 minutes later on a bicycle about a mile from his home and took him into custody. What could possibly lead a son to be accused of cutting off his own mother’s head and then disposing of her body as if trash? The younger Gomez – who admitted to the murder, according to the Sheriff’s Office – was apparently fed up with his mother’s “nagging” over the previous two days about moving some boxes into the attic, Sheriff Bob Gualtieri told CNN. Christian Gomez, 23, has been charged with first-degree murder and is in the Pinellas County Jail.

Rutledge – who put herself through school and was a chemical engineer – “was a fun-loving, outgoing, outdoorsy person,” said Terry Rutledge. “Her family liked to camp, hike, do outdoorsy things.

Florida State (13-1), the defending national champion, was done in by five turnovers. The miscues included a fumble in the third quarter by quarterback Jameis Winston that was turned into a back-breaking 58-yard touchdown return by Ducks linebacker Tony Washington. Oregon scored four TDs in the third period to lead 45-20 going into the fourth. “We just turned the ball over too many times.

124,124,01/01/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2014/12/18/us/california-rains-and-drought/index.html,What deluges? 11 trillion gallons of rain still needed to end California drought,US,CNN,"About 11 trillion gallons of rain, or nearly 17 million Olympic swimming pools full. That’s how much water California needs to recover from its extreme drought despite downpours that caused flooding and mudslides this month, NASA said. This week, the space agency released a satellite data analysis of how much water the state’s reserves lack. It’s a lot – more than 14,000 times the amount of water it would take to fill the Dallas Cowboys stadium, according to CNN calculations. It’s the amount of water that flows over Niagara Falls in about 170 days’ time. “It takes years to get into a drought of this severity, and it will likely take many more big storms, and years, to crawl out of it,” said NASA scientist Jay Famiglietti, who led the study. NASA climate satellites measured fluctuations in Earth’s gravitational field and the changing shape of the planet’s surface to determine the drop in water reserves. It’s the first calculation of its kind to determine the amount of water needed to break a drought, the space agency said. Virtually all of California is drought stricken, according to the University of Nebraska Lincoln drought monitor, most of it under the worst level – “exceptional drought.” Deluges boosted state reservoirs December’s deluges doused parts of California in just a few days with double the rain or more that they usually get in a year. An atmospheric river – a moisture-laden stream of air from the tropics dozens of miles wide – hosed the coast, and behind it, storm fronts battered the state. Nearly a foot of rain fell in some places in a single day. Creeks and rivers previously flowing at a trickle swelled over their banks and flooded nearby streets. The abundant rainfall gave the state’s reservoirs an upward bounce, according to measurements by the Department of Water Resources. One of the largest, Lake Shasta, went from a water level before the rains of 41% of its historic average to 53% on Tuesday. Another very large one, Lake Oroville, stepped up from a level of 44% of its average volume to 54%. Some of the state’s other 10 – mostly much smaller – main reservoirs felt a boost, too. Others, not so much. More rain is in the forecast this week, but it will be gentle, not torrential. Despite the new rain, California’s mighty reservoirs still resemble ponds surrounded by parched, elongated banks. Depleting groundwater The drought has dug so deep in the past three years that it has tapped into groundwater. It has done this throughout the Southwest, where groundwater levels are at their absolute lowest levels in the last 65 years, said NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. The state’s two largest river basins, the Sacramento and San Joaquin, have lost 4 trillion gallons of water per year since 2011, according to the analysis by NASA JPL. “That’s more water than California’s 38 million residents use each year for domestic and municipal purposes. About two-thirds of the loss is due to depletion of groundwater beneath California’s Central Valley,” NASA said. In September, Gov. Jerry Brown signed “historic legislation” that created “a framework for sustainable, local groundwater management for the first time in California history,” the governor’s office said at the time. Before the new legislation, California was the only Western state that didn’t manage its groundwater, officials said. Brown declared a drought emergency, saying this was “perhaps the worst drought that California has ever seen since records (began) about 100 years ago.” He held up a chart of fluctuating rainfall levels over many years, with the graph plummeting off the bottom of the chart in recent years. Diminished snow caps The atmospheric river and cold fronts loaded up the Sierra Nevada mountains with a couple of feet of snow at the highest altitudes, adding to the snowpack. It acts as a major water reservoir, storing up moisture in the winter months and then releasing it during melts. The storm’s extra padding doubled the level to 48% of the historic average, a nice improvement. But there’s bad news here, too, based on studies done from airplanes this year, NASA said. “The 2014 snowpack was one of the three lowest on record and the worst since 1977, when California’s population was half what it is now,” said NASA JPL scientist Tom Painter. That not only means less water from snow but also less reflection of sunlight, which means the Earth absorbs it and gets that much warmer, Painter said. The ground then also gets more parched, so when water does flow onto it, it soaks it up, leaving less of it to flow into reservoirs. —-",4592,Ben Brumfield,0.049,0.925,0.026,-0.9666

127,127,01/01/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2014/12/22/us/new-york-police-officers-killed/index.html,"After 2 NYPD officers killed, more threats against police emerge",US,CNN,"The cop-killer didn’t seem to have a specific target – just any two officers in uniform. And on the day of his deadly attack, those officers just happened to be Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos. While patrolling a Brooklyn neighborhood Saturday, the New York police officers were killed by the man who had also just shot his ex-girlfriend – and apparently broadcast his intention to kill police on social media. Here’s what we know about the shooting, the victims and the latest threats against police: The attack Liu and Ramos were sitting in their patrol car in a high-crime part of Brooklyn when – without warning – the gunman shot them in the head. “They were, quite simply, assassinated,” New York City Police Commissioner William Bratton said. Tantania Alexander, the first emergency medical technician on the scene, became emotional when she described looking into the patrol car. “He has a family,” Alexander remembers thinking. “You don’t know if he’s going to go … you put your life on the line every day for people.” Police said the shooter was 28-year-old Ismaaiyl Brinsley. Hours before he killed Liu and Ramos, Brinsley shot his ex-girlfriend near Baltimore. The woman, 29-year-old Shaneka Nicole Thompson, was shot in the stomach but survived. A series of social media posts believed to be from Brinsley gave ominous clues that police would be next. The warnings It was one of the ex-girlfriend’s friends who alerted Baltimore County Police to troubling Instagram posts that the friend believed came from Brinsley. “These posts included overt threats to kill police officers,” police said. And they appeared to be posted in Brooklyn, New York. “I’m Putting Wings On Pigs Today,” one Instagram post read, according to police. “They Take 1 Of Ours, Let’s Take 2 of Theirs.” Brinsley also posted messages of self-loathing and despair and made reference online to Michael Brown and Eric Garner, black men who were killed by police. Around 2:10 p.m., 40 minutes after speaking with the friend, Baltimore County police said they called New York police to warn them. Then they faxed a “wanted” poster with Brinsley’s picture. “Suspect is armed with a 9mm handgun and has posted pictures on Instagram saying that he will shoot a police officer today,” a description on the flier says. But it was too late. New York Police Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said while New York police were spreading the warning, Brinsley ambushed and killed the two officers. Later, at a nearby subway station, Brinsley was found dead of a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The outrage The officers’ killings came after months of protests over the deaths of unarmed black men at the hands of police officers. In July, New York City police officers wrestled Garner to the ground, with one officer wrapping his arm around Garner’s neck in a chokehold. That officer was not indicted. And in August, Brown was shot by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. That officer also was not indicted. The deaths of Liu and Ramos sparked backlash and finger-pointing.  Former New York Gov. George Pataki and some police union officials blasted New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. Pataki accused de Blasio of putting officers’ lives at risk by supporting recent protests over the deaths of Garner and Brown. De Blasio did not respond to the denunciations against him, but condemned the officers’ “assassination.” Bratton sought to tamp down the anger on Monday. Asked by NBC’s “Today” whether de Blasio should apologize to police, Bratton said, “I don’t know that an apology is necessary.”  The issue is “starting to shape up along partisan lines, which is unfortunate,” he said. “This is something that should be bringing us all together, not taking us apart.” Bratton spoke positively of de Blasio, saying he has received an additional $400 million this year to improve training and equipment for police, including equipping every police officer with a smartphone. Bratton compared the current tensions to what he saw in the 1970s when he first got into policing.  “Who would have ever thought – deja vu all over again – that we’d be back where we were 40 years ago,” Bratton said, adding that social media now spread the word quickly. “We’re in a change moment” in the United States, he said.  The goal is to find opportunities to move forward. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said on CNN Monday that he didn’t think de Blasio holds responsibility for the officers’ slayings but the mayor, along with President Barack Obama and U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder, have contributed to what Giuliani described as “hate speech” and anti-cop “propaganda.” “They are perpetuating a myth that there is systemic police brutality,” the ex-mayor said. “There is systemic crime.” Police brutality merely happens occasionally, Giuliani argued. CNN anchor Chris Cuomo responded, Shouldn’t there be no police brutality? Giuliani countered that the greatest must be a focus on what he sees as high black on black crime and that instances of police brutality have been overstated and over-hyped this year in the wake of Brown and Garner’s deaths. Former Boston police commissioner Edward Davis, also appearing on CNN, said that de Blasio has gotten resources to Bratton to help step up officers’ security in the wake of this weekend’s killings. Now the mayor must reach out to the police department and do what it takes to mend fences. Police are taught not to paint the public with a broad brush, said Davis. “Our leaders need to understand that our police deserve that same credit.” Michael Brown’s family condemned Saturday’s slayings. “We reject any kind of violence directed toward members of law enforcement. It cannot be tolerated. We must work together to bring peace to our communities,” the family said in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the officers’ families during this incredibly difficult time.” The Rev. Al Sharpton – who is also a target of criticism – said the Garner family was outraged by the police officers’ killings. “Any use of the names of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, in connection with any violence or killing of police, is reprehensible and against the pursuit of justice in both cases,” Sharpton said. The new threats As they grieve the deaths of two of their colleagues, New York police must also deal with a spate of new threats. The NYPD is investigating more than 15 threats to officers posted on various social media platforms and trying to determine whether any are serious or credible, a senior New York City law enforcement officer told CNN. The department’s intelligence division continues to monitor social media for threats made to the NYPD. Officials have not released details about any potentially credible threats. But the troubling messages aren’t just coming from New York. A Memphis, Tennessee, man has been questioned after allegedly posting threats against the NYPD, CNN affiliate WREG reported. “Good job. Kill em all I’m on the way to NY now #shootthepolice 2 more going down tomorrow,” an Instagram post read. The NYPD has already pulled all of its auxiliary officers off the streets in the wake of the killings of the two officers. Auxiliary officers are unarmed volunteer officers who help with traffic control or other minor situations. The victims Both Liu and Ramos dreamed of being police officers, Bratton said. Liu, 32, was a seven-year veteran and married just two months ago, WABC reported. Ramos, 40, joined the force two years ago after spending three years as a school safety officer. Ramos was married and has a 13-year-old son.

And until CNN got involved, the Department of Defense was about to significantly cut their reimbursements for lodging, meals, and incidentals, which allow them to do their important work. “My job (was) to be with my son pretty much 24/7,” Morgen Hummel, the mother of Sgt. Adam Hartswick, told CNN. Hartswick, an Army senior combat medic, lost both his legs after an improvised explosive device detonated under him in Zhari Province, Afghanistan, in 2013. “Not only did my son lose his legs … but then financially if you got to worry about – is my house going to be here when I get back from tending to my son, that’s a double whammy,” Hummel said. The Department of Defense reimbursement allowed Hummel to leave her job to care for her son, “and not worry that I couldn’t pay my mortgage when I came back.” The Pentagon classifies caregivers such as Hummel as NMAs, or “non-medical attendants.” They are sometimes family, or friends, or others, who work with troops who have been severely wounded, often with missing limbs or debilitating brain injuries. They treat their wounds, help them re-learn how to stand, or walk, or speak, and nurse them to as much independence as they can achieve. All this was at risk when a Pentagon rule went into effect on Nov. 1, 2014, that sought to eliminate $22 million from the budget by discouraging excessive travel for both uniformed and civilian employees of the Department of Defense. That rule would have cut the per diem to 55% reimbursement for lodging, meals and incidental expenses for those whose work extended beyond six months, or 181 days. Obviously, the work done by these NMAs can last far beyond half a year. One wounded warrior, worried that the rule change would cost him his caregiver and thus risk his recovery, reached out to CNN. We in turn contacted the Pentagon, demanding to know why these crucial funds were being cut. To its tremendous credit, the Pentagon acknowledged the problem and fixed it immediately. The original rule was an attempt to discourage unnecessary travel, a spokesperson for Pentagon told CNN, but NMAs got swept up in the rule inadvertently. “We want to thank you Jake and CNN for bringing it to our attention because we had not seen this unintended consequence of what was, in every other respect a very sound an judicious financial policy. But you brought it to our attention,” Pentagon spokesman Rear Admiral John Kirby told us. “And we were able to get it changed within a week.” NMAs will continue to be reimbursed as long as they need to be, and those NMAs affected by the November 2014 budget rule will be able to claim back money spent during that time. What would have happened to attendants, and the wounded warriors for whom NMAs care without that funding? “I would have had to leave Adam and I think his dad would have, too,” Hummel speculates. “We wouldn’t have been able to stay with Adam and I’m sure he wouldn’t be as far along in his recovery and I would say that for anybody. They need that help, they really do.” NMAs take up temporary residence wherever wounded warriors, still in the military, are cared for: at Walter Reed Medical Center, at Brooke Army Medical Center (BAMC), at Madigan Army Medical Center, Navy Medical Center San Diego, at the Air Force 59th Medical Wing, Joint Base San Antonio, Texas. When the troops transition out of the military, so too do their caregivers. Because numbers are kept on an installation level, it is difficult to pull together a full number of NMAs. There are currently 69 at Walter Reed, many of whom are there for more than 30 days. BAMC, Madigan, and Balboa have 22 NMAs, including 17 long-term. After Staff Sgt. John Faulkenberry had his right leg shot off during the Battle of Saret Koleh in Nuristan Province, Afghanistan, in July 2007, his wife Sarah had to quit her job as an event planner in Midland, Texas, and move to a modest hotel on the grounds of Walter Reed for 10 months. The per diem reimbursements as an NMA “gave me the freedom to solely focus on him and his recovery,” she tells CNN. “You want to help them become independent,” she says of her mission. But it was a long haul. Faulkenberry had dozens of surgeries on his leg as doctors constantly had to clean the wound, trying to save as much of it as they could. She helped him with daily living activities, getting food, using the rest room, and making appointments. She became trained in wound care and changing his bandages; she learned how to administer shots to deal with his blood clots; she was taught how to administer IV antibiotics to help him with his infections so he didn’t have to stay in the hospital. She says she can’t imagine going through that with added financial stresses. “You don’t need to be worrying about that sitting next to your husband who saw two guys killed and is bleeding everywhere,” she says. It’s even more difficult, Sarah says, for parents of wounded warriors who become NMAs, who don’t get the military salaries that couples get. Such as Morgen Hummel who continues to care for her son Sgt. Adam Hartswick. “At first we pretty much marathoned it with Adam. We would stay there from sunrise to sunset, and beyond,” Hummel said. “Having your mom there is important,” Hartswick said. “And having my dad there to, you know, wake me up in the middle of the night and keep me calm, that was vital to my recovery.” Hartswick has made great strides in regaining his independence. He is now out of the hospital, and even dating. Now, with these funds restored, families like Hartswick’s will be able to continue the journey back from battle, together.",5720,Jake Tapper,0.068,0.827,0.105,0.992

Steve Scalise, after Scalise distanced himself from an event hosted by Duke’s white nationalist group. During an interview on the Jim Engster Show, audio of which was obtained by BuzzFeed, Duke calls Scalise a “sellout” for saying his appearance at a meeting of the European-American Unity and Rights Organization in 2002 was a “mistake.” “He’s a sellout,” Duke said. “He’s not David. He used to say that he was David Duke — of course, without the baggage, whatever that means.” READ: Steve Scalise fallout: What you need to know “It wasn’t a Klan meeting. It wasn’t any sort of a radical meeting, it was a meeting that said there was European-American rights, right? So he is a sellout, right? Because, you know, he can’t meet with members of his own district who have opinions like I have, but he meets with radical blacks who have total opposite political positions than him,” he added. Duke said that a majority of the voters in Scalise’s district voted for him when he ran for statewide office in Louisiana, and that by apologizing for attending the conference, Scalise is “insulting” his constituents. And while he admitted he’s not registered to vote in Louisiana, he “might just register” in order to run against the congressman. “I just might have to run against Steve Scalise because you know — I really might. I mean, I’m definitely going to consider it because it’s so disgusting to me to see … he got elected on false pretenses,” he said. Scalise weathered calls to resign after a local political blog uncovered postings indicating he spoke to the group over a decade ago. The congressman first said he didn’t remember speaking to the group, then apologized, and later conflicting accounts of the event raised questions about whether he spoke to the conference itself, or simply to a group of interested locals before the conference started. House leadership stood by the majority whip, and talk of the scandal has died down in recent weeks. But he does represent a deep-red district, and there had already been talk of a primary challenge — from former tea party-backed Senate candidate Rob Maness. If both Maness and Duke challenged him, however, Louisiana’s jungle primary system — in which the top-two vote getters head to a runoff if no candidate gets more than 50% in a primary — would give Scalise a better-than-even shot at re-election.",2461,Alexandra Jaffe,0.072,0.895,0.033,-0.967

But Kerry was slapped with a $50 fine this week when he didn’t clear a sidewalk on the side of his home in Boston, where a blizzard heaped more than two feet of snow earlier this week. Kerry was abroad with President Barack Obama in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday when the snowstorm hit New England. Kerry was hit with the fine after a passerby submitted a picture of the snow-filled sidewalk on the city of Boston’s online “Citizens Connect” portal on Wednesday. The snow removal company tasked with clearing the sidewalk alongside Kerry’s home initially cleared the front of Kerry’s home, but mistook yellow caution tape set up on the side of Kerry’s home as police tape and steered clear, Kerry’s spokesman Glen Johnson said. The tape had been put up to warn passersby of falling snow and ice overhead, Johnson said.

Lindsey Graham says he is testing the waters on a presidential run because he is sick of hearing himself complain. “I complain a lot and also have some solutions. I’m tired of just complaining and now ready to try to lead. Whether or not there is a market for me, I won’t know until I try,” Graham told CNN in an interview. Graham set up a new political organization on Thursday called “Security Through Strength,” which will allow him to raise money and hire a political staff as he weighs whether to officially run for president. The South Carolina Republican said he expects to make a decision by the end of April. Graham is a conservative, but bucks his party on big issues like immigration, where he thinks there should be a path to citizenship, and climate change, which he believes is at least in partly the result of human activity. READ: Have Republicans wised up about 2016? “Conservatism will sell to any demographic in this country as long as it’s sold in a way to be inclusive and not hateful,” said Graham. He made a point of noting that he beat back several challengers from the right in a GOP primary last year for his Senate seat in South Carolina, a conservative state. “I’m not going to run away from the idea that the President of the United States has to bring the parties together. Conservatism is an asset in terms of winning a national election, but what is needed more than conservatism or liberalism is pragmatism and somebody that can get a result. Only time will tell,” said Graham. When asked what he would bring to the table that other establishment Republicans like Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney or Chris Christie do not, Graham focused immediately on foreign policy. “It will be about who can best protect the county, who has an alternative to Obama on foreign policy at a time when we need one,” Graham said. “Ronald Reagan said that his platform was peace through strength. I’ve concluded that with radical Islam, peaceful coexistence is nonexistent, is a fantasy. I think I can articulate how to straighten out a screwed up world when it comes to national security.” Graham says he believes he can be competitive in Iowa, as well as New Hampshire, the second Republican contest. The next would be his home state, where he says he is confident he could win. There is no guarantee of that, of course. Graham won his GOP primary for the Senate in large part because he worked to keep formidable conservative opponents off the ballot. Still, South Carolina is his home turf where voters know him, and some Republicans there who relish their role as the GOP gateway to the South in the presidential process, are privately concerned that Graham getting in could effectively take that state off the map. Graham, an Air Force reservist who is still a military lawyer, is one of the Senate’s leading foreign policy hawks, so it’s clear he thinks national security is his main calling card in any presidential race. But he also plans to push the desire for deal-making on the domestic front. “I’ve gotta convince people that not only would I be a good commander-in-chief but I can do more than the foreign policy stuff, that I can be someone that gets both parties in a room that comes out with an outcome,” said Graham. Graham was a constant presence on the presidential campaign trail in 2000 and 2008 when his close friend, Sen. John McCain, ran for president. SEE ALSO: Graham forms committee to test 2016 waters McCain on Thursday called Graham his “best friend” and also recently joked that Graham, almost two decades younger than McCain, is his “illegitimate son.” “Well, I hope I get to be in his will now that I’m his illegitimate son – which was news to me and Cindy [McCain] and everybody else,” Graham joked. But Graham then got serious, and emotional, talking about the fact that McCain has been telling anyone who will listen for months he believes Graham should throw his hat in the presidential ring. “John is a dear friend. One of the highlights in my time in politics is him, and I know he loves me dearly,” Graham said, as he tried to fight back tears. “We are truly friends, but he wouldn’t say to anybody that I should be president if he didn’t really mean it, and believe it.” He calls McCain’s encouragement a “personal honor I will cherish,” but also says that it is “not going to carry the day for me.”",4349,Dana Bash,0.028,0.809,0.163,0.9991

Chris Christie and Mitt Romney will have dinner Friday night in New York City, just hours after Romney announced he won’t be seeking a third run for president. According to a source familiar with the dinner, their wives may also attend. The two men are friends. “Real friends, not political friends,” as Christie has previously said. The source warned against expecting Romney to endorse anyone in the near future, or perhaps at all, saying the 2012 GOP nominee will be out helping the party, but not necessarily for any one 2016 candidate. Romney is in New York Friday to attend a private lunch event for the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital. An aide to Romney said the dinner is a “social meeting” and “was arranged a while ago.” Christie was vetted in 2012 to be Romney’s potential running mate, but it was later made public in the book “Double Down” that concerns came up during the vetting process about Christie’s health and weight, as well as a controversy involving Christie’s time as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey. Romney aides and supporters also came to resent Christie after he teamed up with President Barack Obama a week before the election to survey damage in New Jersey after Superstorm Sandy. Critics argued that Christie’s praise of Obama at the time elevated the president just days before voters headed to the polls. Romney later said he had no bad feelings against Christie about the episode. “You have to look at Chris and say this is a guy who’s been a very effective governor and has a great potential for leadership,” Romney told CNN’s Gloria Borger in 2013. About a year ago, when being pressed about a third run for president, Romney instead pointed to Christie and other Republicans as potentially strong GOP nominees. “I want to make sure that we take the country in a different direction. I think that Chris Christie and Paul Ryan and Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, and the list goes on, have a much better chance of doing that, and so I will support one of them as they become the nominee,” Romney told the New York Times. It was one of many times Romney praised the New Jersey governor last year. Romney appeared as a special guest at Christie’s birthday fundraiser in New Jersey last September. They shared the same stage at an event that in many ways appeared to foreshadow a potential campaign event if Christie were to run for president, complete with a highly complimentary introduction by Romney, an American flag as a backdrop, and an excited audience. “This is a guy who cares about the people in this great state, he cares about the poor, he cares about the middle class. He cares about getting good jobs,” Romney said. “This is a guy who fights for the things he believes in.” The love-fest continued when Christie was at the podium. “Wouldn’t our country be a hell of a better place if this man were the President of the United States?” Christie roared.​",2944,Dana Bash,0.046,0.781,0.174,0.9976

Mitt Romney will not make a third run for president, he told supporters on a Friday morning call, saying he believes it’s “best to give other leaders in the party the opportunity” to become the nominee. Romney acknowledged during the call that he may not have been the strongest contender for the GOP in a general election, and said that was the primary motivation behind his decision. Former Romney co-chair ‘not happy’ with 2016 interest “I feel that it is critical that America elect a conservative leader to become our next president. You know that I have wanted to be that president. But I do not want to make it more difficult for someone else to emerge who may have a better chance of becoming that president,” he said. The 2012 GOP nominee said on the call that he’ll “do whatever I can” to help elect that person — and attempted to tamp down any further speculation over whether he’ll change his mind. “That seems unlikely,” he said. “Accordingly, I’m not organizing a PAC or taking donations; I’m not hiring a campaign team.” Romney said that while he’s “convinced that we could win the nomination … it would have been a difficult test and a hard fight.” “Our finance calls made it clear that we would have enough funding to be more than competitive. With few exceptions, our field political leadership is ready and enthusiastic about a new race. And the reaction of Republican voters across the country was both surprising and heartening,” he said, noting early primary polling that’s had him leading the potential GOP primary field. But since his surprise announcement to donors earlier this month that he was interested in making another bid, Romney has had a rocky start. Wall Street wasn’t ready for another Mitt Romney campaign He’s faced deep skepticism from some quarters within the party, including some of his major donors and former campaign aides. Many expressed concerns that Romney wasn’t the best option to take on expected Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, whom the GOP plans to portray as old news and out of touch — both characterizations that could dog the former Massachusetts governor if he runs again as well. And the decision this week of a top Romney operative in Iowa to sign up with Bush’s campaign was the latest in a series of defections, raising doubts on Romney’s chances going forward. But Romney’s decision not to run doesn’t remove him from the 2016 calculus. Rather, it sets him up as a certain kingmaker in the wide-open GOP primary, as he still holds sway over many major donors and has deep respect within the party. And it solidifies former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s position as the preferred candidate of the establishment in the GOP primary, improving his chances in the overall fight. A wide array of conservative contenders are expected to jump in the race and will jockey for position; Romney’s exit leaves just Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie as the clear establishment contenders. Bush used his social media accounts Friday to praise Romney’s decision. “Though I’m sure today’s decision was not easy, I know that Mitt Romney will never stop advocating for renewing America’s promise through upward mobility, encouraging free enterprise and strengthening our national defense,” Bush posted on his Facebook wall Friday after the announcement came. “Mitt is a patriot and I join many in hoping his days of serving our nation and our party are not over.",3438,Alexandra Jaffe,0.039,0.781,0.18,0.9983

A clandestine U.S. program monitoring the released Taliban fighters’ communication uncovered evidence that one of them has “reached out” to try to encourage militant activity, an official told CNN. He is currently classified as being “suspected” of returning to terrorist activities, but some within the administration believe the evidence of his communication is strong enough to classify him as “confirmed” having returned to illegal activities. Officials: Detainee swapped for Bergdahl suspected of militant activities But for Clinton, who praised the swap and downplayed the potential security risks of the prisoners’ release, the news could become a political headache as she contemplates a presidential bid. The Republican National Committee and the GOP opposition research firm America Rising both went after the former secretary of State. While she did push for a tougher deal for the swap, they pointed to her comments during a June Today Show appearance that “these five guys are not a threat to the United States” as evidence she’s out of touch with the national security challenges facing America, and tied her to President Obama on the issue. “Each passing day, the Obama-Clinton foreign policy continues to unravel,” RNC spokesman Michael Short wrote in an email to reporters. Republicans believe national security will be a key issue in the upcoming presidential campaign, and see an opening for attack on what they believe has been a flat-footed and hapless foreign policy from Obama. They’ve sought to tie Clinton — who’s the overwhelming front-runner on the Democratic side — to Obama on the issue, and point to her time as secretary of State as evidence she should be held responsible for national security threats that have grown on his watch.",2012,Alexandra Jaffe,0.07,0.822,0.108,0.9121

Romney’s decision came exactly three weeks after he told a roomful of donors that he was seriously considering a run for president, a move that shook up the field of prospective GOP presidential candidates. But on Friday Romney’s would-be foes showered praise on the former 2012 Republican nominee. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who would have had to jockey with Romney for the establishment vote, praised Romney as a “leader in our party” and wrote in a Facebook post that he looks forward to working with Romney in the future. RELATED: White House deletes blurred Mitt Romney-Suge Knight tweet “There are few people who have worked harder to elect Republicans across the country than he has. Though I’m sure today’s decision was not easy, I know that Mitt Romney will never stop advocating for renewing America’s promise,” Bush said. “Mitt is a patriot and I join many in hoping his days of serving our nation and our party are not over.” Bush had spent recent days and weeks scrambling to lock up establishment donors and snagged a big win Thursday when he pulled one of Romney’s top aides David Kochel to join his team. Bush will still have to contend with a wide open field of more than a dozen Republicans who are likely to vie for the party’s nomination. And they too welcomed Romney’s announcement Friday. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky wished Romney and his wife, Ann, “the best” on Twitter. “My family & I wish Mitt & Ann the best. We have gotten to know them over the last few years & deeply respect their family & Mitt’s service,” Paul tweeted. “I hope to work together with Mitt to grow our party and lead our country forward.” Sen. Marco Rubio, who is also eying a run, praised Romney, recognizing “what a difficult decision this must be given his love of our country.” “He certainly earned the right to consider running, so I deeply respect his decision to give the next generation a chance to lead,” Rubio said. “Over the past two years, there hasn’t been a day when I didn’t think that Mitt Romney would have been a better president than Barack Obama.” Romney said Friday in a call to supporters that he wanted to “give other leaders in the party the opportunity” to become the nominee. “I feel that it is critical that America elect a conservative leader to become our next president. You know that I have wanted to be that president. But I do not want to make it more difficult for someone else to emerge who may have a better chance of becoming that president,” Romney said. Sen. Lindsey Graham said Friday on CNN he was “a little bit surprised” by Romney’s decision to step away from the 2016 presidential race and praised the former nominee as a “good man” who would have made a good president. Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, set up a political action committee this week to begin testing the waters for a presidential campaign of his own, one that would play heavily on foreign policy and the need for a strong military in a time of global turmoil. Graham said Romney’s decision doesn’t “at all” impact his thought process on a potential bid. “It’s just one less good person to choose from,” Graham said. “Whether it works for me I don’t’ know but I’m going to take a look at it.” Even Sen. Ted Cruz, who had said Republicans would lose the presidency with a Mitt Romney-style candidate in 2016, praised Romney in a post on Facebook for his record as governor and in business. “He worked tirelessly in 2008 and 2012 to try to turn our country around,” Cruz said. “Regardless of whether he is a candidate, Governor Romney will continue to be a respected leader having a positive impact on our national discourse.” Cruz this weekend also pointed to Romney’s 47% comments as the reason the GOP lost in 2012. Meanwhile, Romney will sit down with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for dinner on Friday and Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin tweeted that he spoke with Romney. “Had a great conversation w/ @MittRomney. He’s a good man. Thanked him for his interest in opening the door for fresh leadership in America,” Walker tweeted. Donald Trump, the billionaire who is flirting with a presidential run, called Romney’s decision “the right thing” and took credit for Romney’s decision to step back in a series of tweets Friday afternoon. “I will take full credit for Mitt Romney dropping out of the race—looks like he won’t be endorsing Trump any time soon,” Trump tweeted, less than a week after he proclaimed in Iowa that Romney “had his chance” and  “he choked.” “Mitt did the right thing—not because he had to– but because he never would have been given a second chance after his first fiasco,” Trump tweeted. “Now that Mitt is gone, all we have to do is get Bush to drop out and Trump to run—and we will win!”",4899,Jeremy Diamond,0.035,0.796,0.169,0.9993

As he gets ready to take on the most volatile issue yet in the new Congress – how to avoid a potential shutdown of the Department of Homeland Security, which runs out of money at the end of February – Boehner has to maneuver demands from both sides of his conference. As has become recent tradition the Speaker is facing familiar criticism from conservative members, who complain he isn’t being aggressive enough in responding to the President’s executive actions on immigration.  But he’s also getting flak from centrist GOP members, who are showing a new willingness to resist going along with legislation they think those in the right wing of their party is pushing too far. The result: votes on two major politically significant bills to Republican activists – one banning late term abortions and one on border security – have been postponed indefinitely. In the last four weeks Boehner had to beat back a challenge in his re-election to a third term as Speaker, manage a divisive vote on immigration policy, defend a late night decision to pull an abortion bill after several GOP women complained it was too extreme.  He was also forced to shelve a GOP border bill, which he hoped would be the first step in his effort to reform the immigration system. “There have been a couple of stumbles,” the Speaker admitted to reporters Tuesday. Two House Republicans lamented to CNN that the series of high profile internal fights were hurting morale and frustrating those who hoped the new session would feature a series of legislative accomplishments instead of fumbles. “We were promised it would get better,” one of these Republicans, who spoke under anonymity to speak freely about private discussions, told CNN. In a closed door meeting with rank and file members earlier this week Boehner pledged that things would get back on track, according to GOP sources who attended.  He conceded that he and his leadership team moved legislation to the floor without going through “regular order” because committees were still being formed and they wanted to start addressing key priorities out of the gate. Going forward the Speaker said members would have more time to review legislation before votes. Boehner is no stranger to complaints from his right flank. Internal skirmishes among House GOP members were a hallmark of his first four years.  On the first day of the new Congress Boehner beat back a challenge from a group of 25 mostly conservatives who wanted to force a change in leadership. But even some of those who voted for Boehner for his third term aren’t convinced he’s listening, so they started a new initiative they say will help keep him honest. “Many of us feel here in Washington that politicians go back home and make promises and then they forget them when they get here,” Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador told CNN. Earlier this week Labrador and eight other House Republicans announced the formation of a new group called the “House Freedom Caucus.”  These members had already been meeting informally to discuss how they could more effectively push for conservative policies.   Labrador said the existing group of fiscal conservatives, the Republican Study Committee (RSC) had grown too big and that these members wanted “something more than a debating society.” Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, a longtime critic of Boehner’s, told CNN he is still waiting to hear how House GOP leaders will fight to roll back Obamacare, fight the President’s policies on immigration, and vote on measures that represent the party’s position on major social issues. “I see no strategic path to do what we promised to do on any of these issues - they just all just seem to be endlessly going nowhere,” Huelskamp said. As some of the right continue to bristle, the larger House majority also includes a segment of centrist members who are wielding new influence. In recent years fears of getting a primary challenge from the right meant most members didn’t publicly break ranks with the mostly conservative House Republican conference. But two times in the last four weeks more moderate members demonstrated they can impact the House agenda. Several GOP women opposed provisions of the House GOP late term abortion bill would turn off young voters and women. Even though leadership aides thought the bill could still pass they abruptly pulled it because they wanted to avoid the optics of women opposing one of the first major bills. RELATED: House passes abortion measure Another segment of House Republicans rebelled against an immigration amendment championed by conservatives. The proposal, which was attached to a spending bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security would effectively end the Administration’s policies that deferred the deportation of those children who were brought to the U.S. by immigrant parents entering the country illegally. Twenty six moderate GOP members voted against it, saying it went too far. It wasn’t enough to block the amendment, but it was a notable group that could be a force in future immigration debates. Many of these centrist members who represent competitive districts see a small window of time for Congress to produce results before the attention turns to the 2016 election. They stress that their colleagues need to be realistic about what can get through both chambers – especially when Republicans don’t have the 60 votes needed in the Senate to overcome a Democratic filibuster. “There are a lot of members who came her to govern like myself and who see this as an opportunity. Let’s not lose this opportunity, let’s not squander it. Let’s get it done and that to me what’s motivating a lot of members,” Rep Tom Reed, of New York told CNN. Boehner starts his second month as Speaker with a vote on an issue that unites House Republicans – repealing Obamacare. The measure will pass easily, but bringing up the issue raises the question about how the GOP would replace the health care law. The Speaker has committed to coming up with an alternative, but the internal divisions among his members about who would need to be covered and how to structure a new system will likely showcase the splits among House Republicans. But the Speaker doesn’t appeared to be phased by the rough first month, or the fights ahead over immigration, the debt ceiling, tax reform and other issues. Asked in an interview on Fox News on Wednesday if this would be his last term, Boehner waved off the question, saying, “No, I’ll be here for a while.”",6618,Deirdre Walsh,0.062,0.853,0.085,0.9825

If a man can dress up as a woman to entertain an audience, then why can’t a white person get on stage in blackface, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney wondered aloud Thursday in a private Facebook post obtained by CNN. “Why is it socially acceptable – as a form of entertainment – for men to put on dresses, make up and high heels and act out every offensive stereotype of women (bitchy, catty, dumb, slutty, etc.) – but it is not socially acceptable – as a form of entertainment – for a white person to put on blackface and act out offensive stereotypes of African Americans?” Cheney wrote in a post on Thursday her private Facebook page. Some of Cheney’s posts appear to only be visible to those who are in her Facebook network. “Shouldn’t both be ok or neither?” Cheney wondered. Cheney, who is openly gay and married, emphasized that she was not drawing any comparisons between white people painting their faces black and transgender individuals, only men who entertain in drag. Cheney said the question was sparked after seeing an ad on TV for the upcoming season of Logo’s RuPaul’s Drag Race. Asked via Facebook message whether she’d like to clarify her comments, Cheney gave a brief response: “Seriously?” It’s not the first time Cheney has taken her views to Facebook. Cheney took to Facebook in Nov. 2013 after her sister Liz, who was campaigning for Senate in the Wyoming GOP primary, reaffirmed her opposition to same-sex marriage. “Liz – this isn’t just an issue on which we disagree – you’re just wrong – and on the wrong side of history,” Cheney wrote then on Facebook.",1814,Jeremy Diamond,0.112,0.836,0.051,-0.9612

The agency tasked with overseeing U.S. reconstruction efforts in Afghanistan released their quarterly report to Congress on Thursday, featuring a series of glaring asterisks. The office of the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, better known as SIGAR, said in its report summary they were unable to present a complete evaluation of reconstruction spending within the report because key data was withheld by the military and the State Department, at least in an unclassified format. READ: Three American contractors killed at Kabul airport The most glaring omission is the absence of information from the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), classified by the Defense Department for the first time this quarter. Additional data on the ANSF was classified last quarter by the International Security Assistance Force. Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Chris Belcher said the decision was made “to address potential concerns about operational security.” “We appreciate, understand and support SIGAR’s responsibility to provide information to Congress and the American public,” Belcher said in a statement. “At the same time, we have a responsibility to protect data that could jeopardize the operational security of our Afghan partners to include unnecessarily highlighting possible vulnerabilities and capability gaps.” Belcher said the Afghan government requested the U.S. not disclose readiness data from the Afghan National Security Forces. According to the SIGAR report, Congress has appropriated more than $65 billion to the Afghan forces to date, more than half of the approximately $104 billion appropriated for relief and reconstruction in Afghanistan generally. SIGAR expressed concern about these decisions in its report and said that earlier this month the military retroactively classified other information it had submitted to the agency only days earlier. Because of the newly classified nature of the data, portions of the quarterly report are now only available to members of congress in a classified annex, and are not available to the public. SEE ALSO: Afghan President: Obama should ‘re-examine’ troop withdrawal This quarter’s SIGAR report was also compiled without input from the State Department on some of their funding efforts. That report noted that while federal agencies are legally required to submit requested data to SIGAR, “the State Department did not answer any of SIGAR’s questions on economic and social development this quarter, and failed to respond to SIGAR’s attempts to follow up.” Asked to comment, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said her department did not purposefully keep data from the agency. “This quarter it took longer than expected to collect and distill the requested information and our response on social and economic issues missed the reporting deadline,” Psaki said at a press briefing on Thursday. “We did however, convey the delay to SIGAR and we did not intentionally withhold information for these quarterly reports. We expect it will be complete in the next quarter with all of the details across the board,” she said.",3321,Laura Koran,0.035,0.908,0.056,0.8053

The forced budget cuts, known as sequestration, which were passed by Congress and signed into law by Obama, took effect in 2013, resulting in sometimes dramatic impacts on agencies across the federal government. Pentagon officials have warned repeatedly the cuts threaten military readiness. READ: White House drops 529 college savings proposal In his speech to House Democrats in Philadelphia on Thursday evening, a White House official said the President “will announce that his budget will reverse harmful sequestration cuts,” claiming they threaten both the economy and U.S. military. Obama’s pitch to tackle the sequester presents the White House with an opportunity to reboot its economic message after administration officials conceded their plans to effectively end 529 college savings plans had become a “distraction.” “This was a concern for both Democrats and Republicans on the Hill. We decided to take that to heart,” White House spokesman Eric Schultz said on Wednesday about the administration’s reversal on its 529 policy. Obama is also expected to hammer GOP lawmakers over a potential fiscal crisis looming for the Department of Homeland Security. SEE ALSO: Democrats press McConnell to drop immigration fight To protest the President’s executive action on immigration late last year, House Republicans insisted on only a short-term infusion of funds for DHS, or continuing resolution that expires at the end of February. “This is a mess they created back in December when they decided to opt for that fight over the immigration reform actions the President took,” Schultz told reporters on Wednesday. Administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, have insisted that the U.S. should avoid budget battles over the department at a time when the nation is facing a myriad of terror threats. Obama is expected to echo that warning in his Thursday address to House Democrats. “The President will join the Democrats in Congress in vehemently opposing that dangerous view and calling for a clean funding bill to ensure we are funding our national security priorities in the face of cyber-security and security threats abroad,” a White House official said about Obama’s upcoming speech. RELATED: Boehner defends immigration lawsuit With the nation’s economic recovery accelerating and the budget deficit on the decline, the White House is eager to engage in a debate with Republicans over what it calls “the era of manufactured crises and mindless austerity.” The government shutdown in late 2013 badly damaged the GOP’s image for months, though not enough to prevent the party from claiming both houses of Congress in the 2014 mid-term elections. Now in control of Congress, Republicans are just as motivated for a new budget clash with Obama. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner said House Republicans have passed measures to replace the sequester in the past as well, but have yet to be impressed with any of the President’s budget proposals. “Until he gets serious about solving our long-term spending problem it’s hard to take him seriously,” Cory Fritz, Boehner’s spokesman said in response the President’s expected remarks.",3420,Jim Acosta,0.099,0.838,0.064,-0.883

The committee’s decision brings the bill one step closer to a vote on the Senate floor, but still months away from any chance of passing the legislation after the bill’s lead Democratic sponsor, New Jersey’s Sen. Bob Menendez, and nine other Democrats vowed to hold off on supporting the bill on the Senate floor. Without those votes, Senate Republicans won’t be able to clear a fillibuster-proof majority and it’s likely they will hold off on a vote. Menendez and the bill’s Democratic supporters, including the Senate’s No. 3 Democrat Sen. Chuck Schumer, promised President Barack Obama in a letter Tuesday they would wait until after the March 24 deadline for Iran to agree to a framework agreement. If no agreement is in sight, the group vowed to vote for the sanctions bill – legislation Obama has threatened to veto. Menendez, Schumer and four other Democrats joined every Republican on the committee in steering the bill through. Just four Democrats voted against the bill, including the committee’s ranking member Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Brown called Menendez and others’ commitment to hold their fire until the March deadline “helpful,” but said they should wait until negotiations reach the deadline for a final deal after June. “It seems to me that those who have the greatest skepticism about reaching an agreement with Iran should also have the greatest reluctance to do anything to undermine our ability to stiffen sanctions on a multilateral basis should the negotiations fail,” Brown said in his opening statement Thursday. “If negotiations fail, Congress and the President will join hands in applying greater pressure.  And we will be in a far better position to ask the rest of the world to join us.” Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama, praised the vote to approve the sanctions bill in a statement Thursday. “I am pleased that the Banking Committee has approved legislation in a bipartisan manner that would impose additional sanctions should Iran fail to reach an agreement by the negotiating deadline,” Banking committee chairman Sen. Richard Shelby said in a statement.  “It is clear that further action is necessary to compel Iran to reach an acceptable agreement, which is why I strongly support this critical bill.”",2431,Jeremy Diamond,0.083,0.714,0.203,0.9958

Mike Pence is scrapping the development of a new state-run website that an internal memo had said his office would use at times to break news ahead of the independent press. The move comes after The Indianapolis Star reported on Monday that the potential 2016 Republican presidential candidate was launching a site called “Just IN” to provide pre-written stories that the state’s media outlets can re-publish. It was to be led by Bill McCleery, a former reporter for the newspaper, and include a managing editor and an editorial board. “At times, Just IN will break news – publishing information ahead of any other news outlet. Strategies for determining how and when to give priority to such ‘exclusive’ coverage remain under discussion,” Pence’s administration said in a question-and-answer sheet sent to state agencies’ communications directors, the Star reported. Pence quickly backtracked, telling a local conservative radio host that he’d only learned of the memo through The Star’s report and that it clashed with his understanding of what was in development: a new one-stop clearing house for state agencies’ press releases. “I’m just telling you that I regret the confusion, and I’m telling you that that memorandum, however well intentioned, used language that was inappropriate,” Pence told WIBC’s Greg Garrison. “It was poorly crafted,” Pence said. “… We don’t have editors in state government, for heaven’s sakes. We don’t have editorial boards in state government.” He officially called off the project in a memo sent to state agency heads Thursday. Instead, he said, his administration will update its current public calendar website. “However well intentioned, after thorough review of the preliminary planning and careful consideration of the concerns expressed, I am writing to inform you that I have made a decision to terminate development of the JustIN website immediately,” Pence said in the memo. The notion of a state-run news agency became a major controversy in Indiana, where it looked like Pence’s biggest move yet to increase controls on what tidbits of information the state’s independent reporters obtain and when. Indiana’s previous governor, Mitch Daniels – who, like Pence, was often touted as a potential presidential candidate – took a looser approach to media. He showed up alone, rather than with an entourage of staffers, at meetings with newspaper editorial boards. And those who worked in both administrations say that under Daniels, state agencies’ media relations staffs were more autonomous. Pence, though, has developed a more cautious style – at times avoiding the local press and handing exclusive details of his legislative agenda and more first to conservative editorial writers. Pence’s “Just IN” site, according to the internal memo obtained by The Star, would have published stories and releases written by agencies’ communications directors, as well as personality profiles. The “Just IN” plan was met with confusion by longtime Indiana Statehouse reporters for independent outlets. The Fort Wayne Journal Gazette’s Niki Kelly tweeted: “So what happens if I ask a state agency for specific information? Do they write my story before I do?” Pence hosted a radio show in Indiana before starting a 12-year career in Congress in 2000. He also sponsored legislation in the House to shield reporters from having to reveal confidential sources. He’d said in 2005 that “as a conservative who believes in limited government, I believe the only check on government power in real time is a free and independent press.” Reports of Pence’s state-run media outlet came as journalists increasingly howl that they’re being cut out of the loop by government officials. White House reporters have long complained about increasingly restricted access to presidents. In recent years one key battle has been over President Barack Obama’s administration’s decision to release the White House photographer’s shots of major moments, rather than allowing independent photographers to document them.",4039,Eric Bradner,0.041,0.929,0.03,-0.6959

There are more than 284 million monthly active users on Twitter and 500 million tweets sent per day, making it an integral platform for engaging conversation with potential voters. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who had a belated arrival to the platform in June 2013, amassed 100,000 followers almost instantly. While her more recent tweets have been to promote book events and speaking engagements, she did use the platform to condemn republicans and weigh in on financial reform: Others are using the platform to exchange snarky jabs and troll followers on a potential 2016 run: But overall, where do they all stand? As probably expected, Clinton has the most followers, followed by former 2012 Presidential candidate and Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. What is surprising however is how Jeb Bush compares. He has the lowest followers of just about everyone in the pack. As for Twitter conversation and mentions, who’s winning engagement? CNN requested data from Twitter to measure engagement rates, using numbers from the start of Clinton’s book tour in June 2014. Clinton again is the clear Twitter front-runner with a 74% increase in followers since June. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, while significantly fewer followers than Clinton and Romney, has seen a 50% increase in combined followers for both twitter handles @Elizabethforma and @Senwarren. Bush, while comparatively stands with the least amount of followers, has seen a significant increase in followers since June 2014, 31%. Romney, who has the second highest following next to Clinton has seen only a 4% increase in followers despite recent talk of a third presidential run.

But reaching a deal on the next question – what exactly to replace the cuts with – will require yet another round of bitter political fighting on Capitol Hill. President Barack Obama is launching a new effort to dial back the spending cuts. He’s highlighting the issue on Thursday evening when he meets with House Democrats at a retreat in Philadelphia. And the budget blueprint he’ll unveil on Monday will call on Congress to do away with the controversial billions of dollars in automatic spending cuts that went into effect in 2013 after lawmakers failed to reach a budget agreement. Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle are quick to acknowledge that there are better ways to rein in the deficit than another round of drastic across-the-board cuts to defense and non-defense spending, scheduled to kick in this fall. But any path to a budget compromise will once again expose the deep ideological divide between Democrats and Republicans on how to cut the deficit. A spokesman for House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) told reporters this week that Republicans have passed legislation on multiple occasions to replace the sequester only to have the president demand tax hikes, making it impossible for Republicans to “take him seriously.” “You’d be very hard pressed to find someone who says this sequestration is great budget policy,” said Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities and a former economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden. “What’s challenging is figuring out how to raise the caps in a way that everybody can agree on.” Obama’s budget will propose raising the defense spending cap by $38 billion and the non-defense spending limit by $37 billion, boosting total discretionary spending levels by about 7 percent. There is widespread concern across the political spectrum that the recent cuts to the defense budget have put the country’s national security at risk. That sets the stage for possible infighting among Republicans between defense and fiscal hawks on how exactly to offset higher defense spending. It could be a particularly difficult task given that many in the party adamantly oppose raising taxes. “While I can see Republicans agreeing to raise the defense cap, it’s going to be hard for Republicans to raise the non-defense cap because they also want to get to a balanced budget,” said William Hoagland, senior vice president at the Bipartisan Policy Center and a former senior Republican staffer on the Senate Budget Committee. “They can’t do those two things without somehow finding a way to offset it.” Complicating matters for the next round of budget negotiations is the brightening economic outlook. The sequester set off alarm bells in 2013, with economists warning that such deep spending cuts could permanently hamper the economic recovery. Two years later, economic growth has picked up significant steam – an outcome that could bolster calls to keep the current spending caps in place. “The president noted during the State of the Union that the deficit is at the lowest level during his presidency. The sequester is a large reason for that,” said Nicole Kaeding, budget analyst for the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute. “The sequester has helped, not hurt, the recovery.” It’s not just the GOP that may see some internal chafing. For Democrats, who argue the economy could have made bigger strides were it not for sequestration, one big question is how hard to push for higher non-discretionary spending. Many have made the case that Republicans’ insistence on deep spending cuts have choked off funding to programs critical to long-term economic growth, in areas like research, education and infrastructure. “For too long, the draconian cuts of the sequester have strangled our investments to keep America No. 1 in the global economy and to ensure our national security,” House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday.",4071,MJ Lee,0.12,0.781,0.099,-0.9502

Several Democrats have told CNN that there is a desire on the part of Clinton and her innermost circle to go as late as possible. But the potential for a summer start to the official Clinton 2016 campaign, first reported this morning by Politico, is only one of the options on the table. The spring launch plan is still seen by most Clinton watchers as the most likely timing scenario.  Under the spring scenario, Clinton could form an exploratory committee or other official vehicle, which has FEC-regulated restrictions for potential candidates, but would enable Clinton to publicly indicate her intentions and begin a new phase of the process without formally launching a full blown campaign until later in 2015. There is some concern among Clinton loyalists that as the increasingly crowded Republican race heats up, the attacks on Clinton could begin to stick without an apparatus in place to answer them. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee who is pondering another run, invoked Clinton numerous times during recent speeches. Related: Romney targets Clinton on wealth The liberal superPAC American Bridge has been countering Republican attacks on Clinton’s behalf but the cover has not necessarily been to the satisfaction of all in Clinton’s orbit. The Democratic National Committee is beginning to take on a larger role in an effort to protect Clinton and the party brand but many Democrats are concerned even that won’t be enough. Some Democrats have also expressed concern that a later start to Clinton’s campaign will appear like the nomination is shaping up to be more of a coronation and a race - something Clinton and her advisers are looking to avoid. However, those pushing for a later start argue that the more Hillary Clinton can stay out of the daily to and fro of presidential politics, the better that is for Hillary Clinton. No top Democrats have made serious moves to challenging Clinton’s informal and all but certain campaign. In addition, with the uptick of Obama’s approval ratings and easing of economic pessimism among the voters, some supporters of a later start argue that Clinton might want to continue to benefit from those environmental conditions before jumping into the daily presidential campaign mix.

The 2012 GOP nominee stopped for some barbeque at The Little Dooey in Starkville less than a couple hours before changing into a suit for a speech at Mississippi State University. An older man sitting in a booth shook Romney’s hand and urged him to run for president. “We need you up there in the White House,” he said. “You’re very kind,” Romney replied, patting the man on the arm. “I wish I were there right now, I gotta tell ya.” As Romney positions himself for a possible third run for president, he’s sketching out what appears to be a new platform that would be heavy on anti-poverty policies and reaching out to nontraditional voters. RELATED: Romney on minority outreach: ‘Stop thinking so much about the primary’ The millionaire also has the challenge of overcoming a narrative leftover from the 2012 campaign that he was out of touch, and he’s already signaled some ways he might reveal a more authentic self if he runs, the Washington Post reported. At the restaurant, Romney teased the reporters who stood close by as he munched on his pulled pork sandwich, saying there’s “an unwritten rule” about not taking pictures of politicians eating. But he continued to eat anyway. “Do you still consider yourself a politician, then?” one reporter asked, to which Romney replied: “You’re taking my picture. What can I say?” Another asked if this is “the new Romney,” noting that he appeared not to care that he was eating before the cameras. “I didn’t know I had a choice,” he shot back, drawing some laughs. After Romney inched through the restaurant to meet students, sign books and take selfies, he sat down with the university’s football coach, Dan Mullen, who led the bulldogs to the Orange Bowl this year. Romney compared the leadership styles of running a business and coaching a football team. In politics, Romney argued, there’s too much emphasis on what a person says, rather than what a person does. “It’d be nice if people who run for office, that their leadership experience and what they’ve accomplished in life would be a bigger part of what people focus on, but it’s not,” he said. “It’s mostly what you say.” What you do, Romney continued, to argue, “is a lot more important that what you say,” noting how a football coach’s reputation is almost entirely based on his record. “You could be the sweetest talking person in the world, but unless you got a record, you’re in trouble,” he said. . While he doesn’t seem to miss the close scrutinizing that comes with running for president, Romney spent the first half of his speech later that night dishing out some 2012 nostalgia laced with self-deprecating humor. He said he received some advice from someone he met on the campaign trail to stop shaving so he can “grow a little more stubble for a few days to look more sexy.” “As if I needed that,” Romney said flatly, drawing a big laugh from the audience. Still, he called it “the most remarkable” journey of his life, and mentioned ordinary people whom he calls “heroes” that he met on the campaign trail. He specifically named two people in Iowa and New Hampshire who followed him to a hoard of campaign events, and he praised them for devoting their lives to people they believed would “make the country better.” Romney offered no specifics about where he stands in his decision making process, but felt confident that “the great days of America have not ended; they’re ahead with the right kind of leadership.”",3640,Ashley Killough,0.033,0.897,0.07,0.9825

He’s expected to use that speech to lobby for tough new sanctions against Iran – putting him at odds with Obama, who has threatened to veto additional sanctions as he tries to hash out a deal to halt Iran’s nuclear program. READ: Democratic senators to hold back on Iran sanctions The President said the United States and Britain had to quickly to put together a trip to Washington for Prime Minister David Cameron this month for the same reason Obama wasn’t meeting with Netanyahu. Cameron didn’t want to make it closer to his country’s May elections. “He insisted that if he wants to come – and it was a very important meeting – he needs to be far away enough from the election that it doesn’t look like in some ways we’re meddling or putting our thumbs on the scale,” Obama said. Obama downplayed differences with Israel over his approach to Iran, saying he hasn’t heard “a persuasive rebuttal of my argument that we crafted very effective sanctions against Iran specifically to bring them to the negotiations table.” Israeli intelligence has confirmed that Iran has rolled back its stockpiles of highly enriched uranium, Obama said. The President said imposing new sanctions now would give Iran a way out of the talks, an outcome no one wants. “For us to undermine diplomacy at this critical time for no good reason is a mistake and that what we need to do is to finish up this round of negotiations, put the pressure on Iran to say yes to what the international community is calling for,” he said. SEE: Why the Iran sanctions fight is a big deal Obama said he’s confident he can successfully lobby Congress to approve a deal once it’s struck. “I’ve said before that we will take no deal over a bad deal,” Obama said. “But if I can prove that the deal we’ve put in place assures us through indisputable verification mechanisms that Iran cannot achieve breakout capacity, if I’ve got a bunch of scientists and nuclear experts saying this assures us that Iran is not on the brink of being a nuclear weapons power, then that’s a public debate we should have.” “And I will then ask every member of Congress to ask why would we reject that deal and prefer a potential military option that would be less effective in constraining Iran’s nuclear program and would have extraordinarily ramifications at a time when we’ve already got too many conflicts in the Middle East,” he said. “And I’m pretty confident I can win that argument.” SEE: Obama says we need more drone regulations",3027,Eric Bradner,0.071,0.848,0.082,0.8067

So?,Politics,CNN,"President Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama made a quick stop in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday to pay respects to the late King Abdullah, and to hold meetings with the new leader, King Salman bin Abdulaziz. But one aspect of the encounter stood out to reporters covering the receiving line at the palace: the first lady shook hands with the king. Islamic law generally forbids men from touching women to whom they are not related. However, that rule is often times overlooked when official diplomatic delegations visit the kingdom. The White House notes that representatives of the United States, including former Secretaries of State Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright, along with German Chancellor Angela Merkel have all visited the Saudi king, and have all shaken hands with members of the Saudi royal family. READ: Is Obama-Modi ‘bromance’ a turning point? Islamic experts also point to another central theme of Islam: hospitality. When one is a guest in someone’s home, they are treated as family. Obama also did not cover her head, eschewing strict religious and cultural customs in Saudi Arabia, where women wear a full-body garment called an abaya and cover their heads with a hijab or the more conservative niqab, which has only a slit for the eyes. Obama’s predecessor Laura Bush also did not cover her head during her 2007 solo visit to Saudi Arabia and neither did Hillary Clinton during a 2010 trip to the kingdom as Secretary of State. Another former secretary of state, Condoleeza Rice, also did not cover her head as she joined the U.S. delegation in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday. But the U.S. State Department advises other American women visiting the country that they could face problems if they don’t cover their heads. “Women who choose not to conform to this dress code face a risk of confrontation by Mutawwa (religious police) and possible detention/arrest,” the State Department says on its website. “While most incidents have resulted only in inconvenience or embarrassment, the potential exists for an individual to be arrested, physically harmed, or deported.” Additionally, female tourists who don’t abide by the dress code or sidestep other religious laws – like walking in public unaccompanied or mingling with men who aren’t relatives – risk being harassed, pursued or assaulted by Saudi citizens, the State Department warns. Pool reporters traveling with the President on Air Force One, also pointed out that in the receiving line at the airport in Saudi Arabia - a more open setting than the palace – Michelle Obama stood next to but slightly behind the President, and held a small black clutch purse in front of her with both hands. Reporters say they noticed that Mrs. Obama waited for a gesture to be made to her by the men who walked by, and if the man initiated a handshake, she smiled and shook their hand. If not, both she and the man politely smiled and nodded heads. Perceived problems of etiquette have come up before with the first lady. In 2009 during her first meeting with Queen Elizabeth in Britain, she drew headlines when she hugged the monarch. British tabloids picked up on the embrace, and some noted that etiquette wasn’t followed, because people aren’t supposed to touch the queen. However, other outlets quickly noted that the queen returned the hug. SEE ALSO: Why the alleged Russian spy ring matters President Obama has had his fair share of criticism as well. Critics took issue when he bowed in front of Saudi King Abdullah at a G20 meeting in 2009, and again for bowing to the Japanese Emperor Akihito. Although, aides at the time told CNN on condition of anonymity that, “It wasn’t a bow. He grasped his hand with two hands, and he’s taller than King Abdullah.” Former Vice President Dick Cheney was one of Obama’s most vocal critics and said an American leader should never bow to anyone. However, a State Department spokesperson at the time told CNN that, “It’s a natural response of the President the first time he meets the Japanese head of state, to show a sign of respect.” Obama defends Saudi relationship: ‘Sometimes we have to balance’",4109,Matthew Hoye,0.087,0.848,0.065,-0.9248

The National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency – a little-known but enormous agency with a broad mission that ranges from supporting U.S. combat efforts to aiding security planning for the Olympics – said Tuesday that one of its off-duty staff members had “self-reported the incident.” READ: Government worker blamed for White House drone That employee, the agency said, “is not involved in work related to drones or unmanned aerial vehicles in any capacity” for the U.S. government. The drone, the agency said, was a personally-owned item. Sources told CNN the man told Secret Service interviewers that he was drinking with friends when he flew the drone. Local prosecutors are now reviewing the case to determine whether they can bring any charges. The man will also “likely” face “disciplinary action” at work, a source familiar with the investigation said. The employee was at work at the agency on Tuesday, an agency spokesman said. The two-foot wide recreational quadcopter had taken off from a neighborhood east of the White House before flying over the President’s residence and above the White House grounds before crashing on the southeast side of the complex. The man who said he was flying the drone was interviewed by Secret Service agents on Monday and has been fully cooperative, Secret Service spokesman Brian Leary said in a statement Monday afternoon. “Initial indications are that this incident occurred as a result of recreational use of the device,” Leary said. President Barack Obama said in an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in India on Tuesday morning that the United States needs to regulate the industry as the recreational and commercial use of drones expands. “The drone that landed in the White House you buy in Radio Shack,” he said, comparing the drone to cyberspace and saying that U.S. laws and regulations still need to catch up with new technologies. “You know that there are companies like Amazon that are talking about using small drones to deliver packages. … There are incredibly useful functions that these drones can play in terms of farmers who are managing crops and conservationists who want to take stock of wildlife,” Obama said. “But we don’t really have any kind of regulatory structure at all for it.”",2451,Eric Bradner,0.026,0.895,0.079,0.9672
151,151,01/28/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/27/politics/us-russia-spies-analysis/index.html,Why the alleged Russian spy ring matters,Politics,CNN,"They weren’t exactly James Bond but the three alleged Russian spies exposed by the FBI are part of the most intense effort by Russia to infiltrate agents onto American soil since the Cold War. In an affidavit unsealed in federal court on Monday, the Justice Department accused Evgeny Buryakov, also known as “Zhenya,” of posing as a Russian banker in Manhattan to funnel economic intelligence to the SVR, Russia’s foreign intelligence agency. Two other Russians, Igor Sporyshev and Victor Podobnyy, were ostensibly diplomats in Russia’s UN mission in New York but are accused of being Buryakov’s SVR handlers. While Buryakov was operating deep undercover and therefore had no diplomatic protection, the other two have immunity and have already left the the United States. Anecdotes in the affidavit portray the accused spies as bumbling and hapless compared to the stereotype of hard-eyed Soviet-era KGB professionals. Still, news of their existences comes at the most perilous moment in U.S.-Russia relations in decades, with Barack Obama and Vladimir Putin at a standoff over issues ranging from Ukraine to Moscow’s claims it has a right to a “sphere of influence” in its backyard. A spy operation will only serve to deepen the hostilities. Professor Mark Galeotti, a specialist in transnational organized crime, security affairs and Russia at New York University, said that Russian operations are cranking up against the U.S. and its European allies. “It is clear that this is a process that has been taking place over time,” he said. “It is not just about throwing money and people into it. It is the tempo and the aggressiveness that is at the height of Cold War levels.” FBI: Russian spies used tickets and hats to try to hide New York activities Edward Lucas, author of “Deception: The Untold Story of East-West Espionage Today,” said “Russian espionage in the West is on a bigger scale than it was during the Soviet period.” “We are an open society so we are very easy to spy on and we are in competition with a very closed society, which is Russia. They use intelligence as one of the most important tools in the Kremlin tool kit.” U.S. authorities agree. “More than two decades after the presumptive end of the Cold War, Russian spies continue to seek to operate in our midst under cover of secrecy,” U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said in a statement. Assistant FBI Director Randall Coleman warned that despite the collapse of the Soviet Union, “espionage is as pervasive today as it has ever been.” “This case is especially egregious as it demonstrates the actions of a foreign intelligence service to integrate a covert intelligence agent into American society under the cover of an employee in the financial sector,” he said. The affidavit contains details of alleged – and apparently fumbling – attempts by the accused SVR agents to recruit female students at a New York University and a boastful American businessman dreaming of riches in the Russian energy industry. Those tid bits have sparked derisive assessments of Moscow’s espionage prowess, echoing the ridicule drummed up by the outing of Anna Chapman in 2010. She was exposed in an FBI probe into 10 Russian deep cover “sleeper agents” and was later exchanged with Moscow in a spy swap. According to the unclassified affidavit, the 2015 spies, like the 2010 brigade, appeared to extract little useful intelligence and appeared not to penetrate deeply into the U.S. financial industry. In fact, the two alleged handlers, were caught on an FBI surveillance tape complaining that life as a spy in the United States wasn’t like it was in the movies. Podobnyy is quoted in the affidavit as saying that he didn’t expect to be “James Bond” but had expected a little more excitement. “Of course, I wouldn’t fly helicopters,” he said, but confessed he had expected to “pretend to be someone else” under an assumed identity. The pair apparently communicated with Buryakov using covert and coded methods and conducted 48 clandestine meetings, unaware they were under surveillance by the FBI. Lucas said that in retrospect their missions might look amateurish, but “all espionage operations look brilliant if they succeed and blundering if they fail.” Close observers of the spy trade argue that media mockery over Chapman, now a TV star and model in Russia, and her apparently unsuccessful comrades in New York, detracts from a long-term, well-financed and painstaking effort by Moscow – and Putin, a former KGB agent  – to insert “illegals” deep into Western society. Peter Earnest, a former CIA case officer who now heads the International Spy Museum in Washington, said that a perception had grown that those swept up in the 2010 operation were part of a hapless “Keystone Cops” operation. “The  Russians under Putin have chosen to invest a lot of money into placing people like that overseas,” he said. “It wasn’t clear to the public what these people were doing.” “They were meant to be sleepers,” Earnest said. “Typically an illegal sent to another country is a sleeper. He or she is available to handle a very sensitive asset, or in the case of wartime, or some sort of confrontation, be available.” While the agents exposed in New York this week were not “sleepers”, they were also evidence of a comprehensive Russian espionage program. The latest National Threat Assessment by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper warned last year that Russia, in addition to challenging U.S. cyber security, was also seeking to target U.S. personnel with access to sensitive computer network information. He named Russia and China as the biggest threats to U.S. state security and said they were seeking data on advanced weapons systems and information on U.S. firms and research institutions that deal with energy, finance, the media, defense and dual use technologies. John Schindler, who spent a decade with the National Security Agency working as an intelligence analyst and counterintelligence officer on Eastern Europe and the Middle East, believes the U.S.-Russia spy wars are as vibrant as ever. “This is the tip of an iceberg,” he said. “The 2010 illegals program that was rolled up by the FBI was a big success but this was not the end of it.” Schindler said that since the demise of the Soviet Union, Russian intelligence services have rebuilt overseas networks, partly to wage “economic war” against the West. Such an emphasis is increasingly important at a time when the United States and its allies are imposing economic sanctions on powerful figures and top firms over Russia’s annexation of Crimea and alleged infiltration into eastern Ukraine. The new Russian intelligence offensive has a world of opportunity. Russian businesses and capital are increasingly important to and invested in the global economy. And the nexus between vast Russian commercial and energy interests, and organized crime offers a shady world where spies can prosper. The affidavit in the Buryakov case alleges that the SVR sought to use an official Russian news organization in the United States to get information about high-frequency automated trading systems used on Wall Street and to gauge interest among brokers about Russian products. While it lays out a comprehensive legal case against the three alleged Russian spies, the document also includes several intriguing story lines and leaves key questions unanswered in the fog of the espionage wars. The document includes transcripts of conversations between Podobnyy, Sporyshev and Buryakov – not just from phone taps, but from what it says are discussions “inside the SVR NY office.” That leaves open the possibility that the FBI managed to get some kind of bug into the super secure premises. Lucas said its mention may be intended to induce paranoia among Russian intelligence chiefs who may wonder what other sensitive conversations were swept up. The document also says that in the summer of 2014, Buryakov “met numerous times with a confidential source working for the FBI.” That revelation may also lead SVR bosses to question the extent of FBI knowledge about their operations. Another question is why did the FBI move now? “Arresting a foreign spy is the last option, you would rather turn them or watch who they are taking to,” said Galeotti. “Why did they decide to arrest this guy? Did they think they would be about to return to Russia? Was it because there was a risk that he was going to stumble across something important? “Was it time to put a shot across the Russian bows?” The idea that the United States wanted to make a political point about its intelligence operations at a time of rising tensions appears supported by the robust language of the Department of Justice Press release. “We will use every tool at our disposal to identify and hold accountable foreign agents operating inside this country – no matter how deep their cover,” said Attorney General Eric Holder. Bharara added: “New York City may be more hospitable to Russian businessmen than during the Cold War, but my office and the FBI remain vigilant to the illegal intelligence-gathering activities of other nations.”",9118,Stephen Collinson,0.082,0.789,0.129,0.9979

The Federal Aviation Administration has issued some guidelines restricting where and how users can fly drones, but the industry is largely unregulated as more companies look to buy and integrate the relatively new technology into their business. The FAA has been working to craft a comprehensive regulatory framework for drones, following calls from Congress and the President. “You know that there are companies like Amazon that are talking about using small drones to deliver packages… There are incredibly useful functions that these drones can play in terms of farmers who are managing crops and conservationists who want to take stock of wildlife.” Obama said. “But we don’t really have any kind of regulatory structure at all for it.” A man operating a drone recreationally early Monday morning apparently lost control of the two-foot wide quadcopter before it crashed on the White House grounds.

A White House official confirmed the move on Tuesday as fierce opposition to the provision was building in Congress, even among fellow Democrats. READ: Obama proposes scaling back benefits of 529 college savings plans “Given it has become such a distraction, we’re not going to ask Congress to pass the 529 provision so that they can instead focus on delivering a larger package of education tax relief,” the official said. Also known as “qualified tuition programs,” 529 college savings plans are typically offered by the states and allow holders to save money and withdraw it tax-free, as long as the proceeds are used towards approved college costs – typically tuition, fees, room, board and other required supplies. Another kind of 529, prepaid tuition plans, let savers prepay for future tuition and lock in current prices, but they typically do not cover other expenses. The reversal was a clear signal the White House had underestimated the popularity of the college savings plans and the backlash any proposal to end the program would cause. Republicans said the idea, floated as part of the Obama administration’s upcoming budget plan, contradicted President Barack Obama’s recent State of the Union theme of “middle class economics.” “It’s another example of his outdated top-down approach when our focus ought to be on providing opportunity for all Americans,” House Speaker John Boehner said on Tuesday. Maine Sen. Susan Collins, a moderate Republican, said the plan never made sense. “It would have led to more student loan debt and undermined the very values that we should be promoting,” she said in a statement. The political damage on Capitol Hill was so clear to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi that she lobbied senior administration officials to drop the proposal even as she was flying on Air Force One with the President from India to Saudi Arabia, a source familiar with the White House decision said. It is unclear how much effort the White House was ever willing to muster to push its 529 plan. There was no mention of the proposal in the President’s State of the Union speech. “We need a tax code that truly helps working Americans trying to get a leg up in the new economy, and we can achieve that together,” Obama said broadly about his education plans. A White House official said the administration can still more than pay for its education proposals, even without the 529 provision, based on savings realized by closing the so-called “trust fund loophole” for wealthier Americans. A White House official said the administration remains committed to other portions of its education tax reform plan. “The 529 provision is a very small component of the President’s overall plan to deliver $50 billion in education tax cuts for middle class families,” the official said. “We proposed it because we thought it was a sensible approach, part of consolidating six programs to two and expanding and better targeting education tax relief for the middle class.” The White House reversal on the 529 proposal was first reported by The New York Times. Late Tuesday, Boehner welcomed the White House decision. “I’m glad President Obama has decided to listen to the American people and withdraw his tax hike on college savings. This tax would have hurt middle-class families already struggling to get ahead,” Boehner said in a statement.",3525,Jim Acosta,0.066,0.843,0.091,0.9533

Huckabee, an evangelical conservative from Arkansas, described the “cultural shock” he experienced while living part-time in New York to work on his Fox News show, calling the city a “different planet” where men and women don’t avoid cursing in professional settings. “In New York, not only do the men do it but the women do it.

Huckabee left the network early this month in order to seriously consider a presidential run. “Frankly, I never conducted ‘business meetings’ at Fox News. I wasn’t there to do business, but to host a show,” Huckabee said, explaining he did business for his “various companies that had nothing to do with Fox News.” The meetings apparently left a mark on Huckabee who said he experienced a “culture of crude” in the New York business world that he would have never found in the South or the Midwest. “You would not have people who would just throw the f bomb and just use gratuitous profanity in a professional setting,” Huckabee said in the radio interview.

But on Wednesday, she’ll walk into a Senate Judiciary Committee where the newly Republican-controlled chamber is seething with anger at President Barack Obama’s administration, and looking for outlets to express it. READ: Obama nominated Loretta who? Specifically, the GOP is looking for opportunities to combat Obama’s executive overhaul of U.S. immigration rules. They’ll seek answers on how the Justice Department will treat new local laws that permit marijuana use. They’ll ask questions about U.S. military interventions overseas. Whether she’s confirmed as Eric Holder’s replacement could largely depend on her answers. Holder had a tempestuous relationship with Congress, particularly House Republicans, and many observers will be watching how Lynch carries herself during the expected scrutiny. The biggest potential hurdle could be immigration. Louisiana Republican Sen. David Vitter said Lynch’s nomination would be an opportunity to swing back at Obama for his post-midterm election executive moves to forestall some deportations. “We’ll have the opportunity to push back on executive amnesty with one of our first major battles: the attorney general nomination,” Vitter said in a statement in December. “The attorney general is one of the linchpins to Obama’s amnesty plan, and I’ll be working to get the new Congress to block this nomination.” Lynch could also face questions about the Justice Department’s investigations of police departments – particularly since her U.S. attorney’s office is leading the investigation into the police killing of an unarmed black suspect in Staten Island. The issue isn’t new to Lynch, who is perhaps best known for her prosecution and conviction of two New York City police officers who sodomized the Haitian immigrant Abner Louima after arresting him outside a Brooklyn nightclub in 1997. Lynch wouldn’t need many Republican supporters to win confirmation, since – unlike most legislation – the Senate currently only requires 51 votes for some presidential nominees. She’s likely to be backed by all the chamber’s Democrats, led by New York Sens. Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand. White House press secretary Josh Earnest has urged Congress to confirm Lynch before Feb. 16, though Senate Republicans appear unlikely to move that quickly.

In recent years, he’s drawn criticism from pro-life activists that once supported him for voting to protect public funding for Planned Parenthood and access to contraception. Ryan wrote in the op-ed that his shift was inspired by conversations with women during his political career, but the move also puts him in a better position politically as he contemplates a potential 2016 challenge to Sen. Rob Portman, a Republican. Ryan told Roll Call that “we’re certainly looking very closely at” a Senate run. And while he’s won re-election to his heavily Democratic district with comfortable margins nearly every cycle since 2002, Ryan’s pro-life stance could have been an obstacle for him in a Democratic Senate primary in the swing state. Indeed, Portman himself has shifted on a key social issue since he was elected in 2010 with Tea Party support. He came out in favor of gay marriage in 2013, also in a newspaper op-ed, citing his experience with his gay son as partial inspiration for the shift.

Bob Menendez promised Tuesday to hold off his support for additional sanctions against Iran until after the initial negotiations deadline. Menendez, the lead Democratic sponsor of the Nuclear Free Iran Act, announced Tuesday during a Senate Banking Committee hearing on Iran that he sent a letter to President Barack Obama vowing – alongside nine other Democrats – not to vote for his own sanctions bill until after the March 24 deadline. Menendez will still help steer his bill through the banking committee on Thursday. The move essentially killed any chance of passing the sanctions bill before negotiators’ deadline to reach a framework agreement, let alone of reaching a majority to surpass the veto Obama has promised to deliver. The news came just a week after Menendez accused the administration of peddling talking points “straight out of Tehran.” Two other Democratic members of the Senate Banking Committee, Sen. Jon Tester and Sen. Chuck Schumer, another key Democratic sanctions supporter, joined Menendez and the six other senators in promising the President not to vote on the sanctions bill until after the March deadline. Schumer said during the hearing Tuesday that he would vote to approve the bill in the banking committee on Thursday to key it up for a full vote if no agreement is in sight.

Bob Corker, chairman of the Seante Foreign Relations Committee, said it’s unlikely the Senate will vote on a sanctions bill with Menendez and key Democrats pulling back. “If we want to speak with one voice and show strength to Iran it’s likely that we’re not going to vote on the Senate floor on sanctions until after March 24,” said Corker, a Republican from Tennessee. Instead, Corker is focused on gathering support for his own bill, which would allow Congress to weigh in on a final deal. Deputy Secretary of State Tony Blinken said Menendez’s decision to pull back recognizes that negotiators “could use the time and space effectively.” He said it answers “a big problem that we had” and stressed that Congress and the administration need to present a united front to the world and Iran as negotiators look to seal a deal. The U.S., Iran and the five other negotiating partners have set a final deadline for July, but administration officials testifying on Tuesday would not guarantee that a deal will be reached in time. “If we get to June and we have the core elements of a deal in place and we’re working on the technical details and it turns out we need a little more time to dot all Is and cross all the Ts, we may seek it,” Blinken said Tuesday. Responding to a question from hawk Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas, Blinken emphasized that the administration was prepared to walk away from negotiations and reimpose sanctions if it’s clear in March that Iran is not moving toward agreeing to a deal that would curb its nuclear program. “If we come to the conclusion … that they’re simply not going to get to yes, that they can’t do it or they won’t do it,” Blinken said. Blinken continued to emphasize the “real risk” a sanctions bill would present to the fate of negotiations. Instead of looking for every way to weigh in with legislation now, Blinken said the Senate should wait until the administration needs to ask Congress to roll back the sanctions currently in place. Despite pledging to hold off on a “yes” vote for his own sanctions bill, Menendez still used his questioning time to deliver a fiery denunciation of Iran’s willingness to ultimately drop its nuclear weapons ambitions and its attempts to sidestep current restrictions to advance its nuclear program. Menendez didn’t even leave time for Blinken to respond, though Blinken asked to address Menendez’s concerns, asserting that the administration is also concerned about Iran’s true motives and has fought back vigorously against Iranian “cheating.” Menendez worked with Sen. Mark Kirk, the lead Republican sponsor of the sanctions bill, to recraft the legislation in an effort to attract additional Democratic support. And it appears he was able to win some support from some of those Democrats on the fence about supporting sanctions legislation. In the letter to Obama, the Democratic senators call themselves “supporters” of the latest Kirk-Menendez bill and vow to vote for the bill after the March deadline “if Iran fails to reach agreement on a political framework that addresses all parameters of a comprehensive agreement.” Menendez won over the support of Sens. Richard Blumenthal, Chris Coons and Joe Manchin, for example, who supported Kirk-Menendez last year but retracted their support after the bill died. The letter appears to be a compromise between the administration’s full-court press urging Congress to give the negotiations more time and the group of sanctions sticklers in the President’s party who are eager to make their mark on the negotiations. The pressure is now on for the Obama administration and its foreign negotiating partners – who have also argued that a sanctions bill would undermine the talks – to convince Iran to drop its nuclear ambitions and make a serious show of good faith with a framework agreement.

After taking the political world by surprise in early January with the formation of a shiny new political committee, Bush has largely receded from public view, instead putting an acute focus on raising money and building what his growing team of aides describe as a “shock and awe” campaign operation. Aside from some previously-booked paid speeches, a series of banal postings on Instagram and Twitter and a few random run-ins with scrap-hungry reporters, the former Florida governor seems determined to avoid the traps of the horse race-driven daily news cycle and the expectations game that comes with it. READ: 2016 race kicks off with long day of auditions in Iowa Bush’s mission in these early days of the cycle is to keep his head down and raise as much money as possible in an effort to muscle out his closest Republican rivals, hire a talented staff and build a high-octane campaign apparatus that can go the distance against Hillary Clinton in 2016. “There is a lot going on under the surface,” said one Bush-aligned strategist who, like most allies interviewed for this story, refused to talk on the record about any campaign plans. “He is still in the process of considering whether to run, but we are building and organizing. It’s a pretty muscular financial and political organization.” Bush skipped the first big Republican event of the presidential cycle this weekend, an “Iowa Freedom Summit” that attracted almost a dozen Republicans pondering presidential bids and a conservative audience that winced at any mention of the former Florida governor, a perceived moderate in the wide-open GOP field. Nor did Bush attend a California forum organized by the Koch Brothers fundraising network, a confab that drew three other senators mulling White House bids. His staffers, meanwhile, are fiercely tight-lipped about his plans and calendar, including a forthcoming book rollout, offering only the blandest of comments to reporters. Bush himself is adept at dodging press inquiries. Last week in Washington, when Bush was in town meeting with financial supporters, a pair of intrepid television producers staked out the potential candidate at a building near the White House. Bush, though, escaped through a back entrance without being seen. The next morning, a group of reporters spied Bush at Reagan National Airport on his way to Utah for a hush-hush meeting with former Republican nominee Mitt Romney, a possible GOP rival in 2016. He swatted away to their queries with practiced ease. “I like to ski, I can’t comment,” Bush told one reporter. When big issues have surfaced – like President Barack Obama’s dramatic changes to the country’s decades-old Cuba policy – Bush has played it safe, opting to make his opinions known on Facebook rather than on television news. RELATED: Sarah Palin and Donald Trump both interested in 2016 runs Bush’s decision to shun the limelight in January 2015 makes sense to veterans of the presidential process. Though the 2016 race would be his first presidential bid, Bush seems determined to avoid the flame wars and Twitter spats that other first-time candidates are dabbling in, attention-sucking moments that can distract a candidates and staffers from their day-to-day goals. “There is still plenty of time,” said Iowa Gov. Terry Branstad. “The caucuses are more than a year away.” Bush’s most high-profile appearance came last Friday during a paid speech to the National Automobile Dealers Association convention in San Francisco. Close-political watchers mined his appearance for clues about a possible message, but he revealed little new about his thinking beyond now-familiar calls for immigration reform and a more “adult” political tone in Washington. Bush advisers are promising a splashier showing on Feb. 4, when Bush is set to address the Detroit Economic Club, a frequent stopover for ambitious Republicans. In the meantime, Bush has been flying around the country courting big Republicans donors and asking them to contribute to his political action committee, Right to Rise PAC, and an affiliated super PAC. “It’s a smart strategy, because you have got to have a lot of money to run,” said Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, who said Republicans “will have a better chance” in 2016 if they nominate a governor or ex-governor not associated with the unpopularity of Congress. According to some Republicans, the Bush committees together are raking in daily sums in the mid-to-high six figures, an intake that should guarantee an impressive showing once the first fundraising quarter concludes in March. “Other candidates aren’t doing that,” said one unaffiliated Republican in Washington who had been recently briefed on the fundraising. Still, Bush backers vigorously deny a report from earlier this month that they are planning to haul in $100 million in the first quarter, a near impossible goal. SEE ALSO: Mitt Romney is beating Hillary Clinton at Facebook Much of the news about Bush’s financial activities is emerging from supportive donors leaking tidbits to reporters. On the staff side, it’s no-comment, all the time. “It’s the Jeb Bush culture,” said one Florida Republican who knows the likely candidate. “It’s consistent with how he ran previous campaigns. Consistent with how he governed. Focus is execution, getting things done and lack of turmoil. That’s the goal anyway. You always fall short from time to time.” The no-nonsense posture of Bush-world makes for a striking contrast when compared to the daily palace intrigue swirling around Romney, Bush’s closest competitor for establishment Republican support. Ever since Romney told a room full of New York donors — many of them already committed to Bush — that he was seriously considering a 2016 bid, seemingly every Romney meeting, lunch, phone call and “private meeting” has surfaced in the press. The read-all-about-it Romney drama is fueled, in part, by a circle of advisers that forged chatty relationships with the national press over eight years of campaigning and are happy to puff up their boss in the media. But despite Romney’s bold moves in recent weeks, even some of his most devoted aides remain uncertain about his 2016 chances. Some believe he’s best-positioned in a wide-open field while others are more torn about his re-emergence, but remain loyal to him nonetheless. Romney’s will-he-or-won’t-he act has a short shelf life, a range of top Republicans and donors groused to CNN. “I think there is a clear connection between endless leaks about high-level staff meetings and tremendous campaign insecurity,” said one senior Republican sympathetic to Bush who has spoken with people in both the Bush and Romney orbits. “Jeb-land seems too busy organizing to worry about leaking trivia.” Romney is expected to make a decision about the race in the next two weeks, according to people who have spoken with him in recent days. But Bush’s quick start might have already boxed out Romney on the fundraising front. In Republican financial circles, talk over the last week has centered on how Bush has already secured commitments from a large swath of Romney’s biggest bundlers and contributors, raising the former Massachusetts governor’s barrier to entry. READ: Romney, Bush meet in Utah Bush is also ahead of Romney in the race for campaign talent, though the hiring process is moving at a somewhat slower pace than the money chase. Since before the holidays, Bush’s two closest political advisers — Sally Bradshaw and Mike Murphy — have been recruiting staffers and consultants with a blizzard of phone calls and a cascade of meetings in Washington and elsewhere. They have focused heavily on staff talent from party committees in Washington and consultancies with ties to the Republican establishment. Already, Bush has tapped U.S. Chamber of Commerce political director Rob Engstrom, who helped engineer the Republican establishment’s national drubbing of the tea party in 2014, as a top adviser. It remains unclear who will run the campaign. Bradshaw, several Republicans said, is likely to remain in a senior adviser role. Sara Taylor Fagen, an Iowa native and former political director for George W. Bush, has been frequently mentioned as a likely campaign manager. Fagen did not respond to a request for comment. Several Republicans familiar with the moves said Bush’s high command has been very aggressive on the digital side, promising to build a state-of-the-art data and digital operation. Bush team has had conversations with a variety of top digital firms in Washington, and Chris Georgia, a former digital staffer for the National Republican Congressional Committee now working for Bush, has already tried to hire away staffers from a handful of leading digital firms. In the pivotal early caucus and primary states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, Bush has been careful to manage expectations, moving slower than most of his rivals. Bush has called the Iowa GOP Chairman, Jeff Kaufman, and Grassley said he has made arrangements to speak with Bush on Tuesday. He has also dialed some party leaders in New Hampshire and South Carolina, but for now appears to be relying on goodwill from early state veterans of his father’s and brother’s political orbits. RELATED: Bush lining up Romney aides Bush is also keeping an eye on Michigan, which has yet to move its primary date from a February slot to later in the year despite the threat of penalties from the Republican National Committee. Former Michigan governor John Engler is keeping tabs on on the state’s primary for Bush and his team. Bush’s organizational strength, fundraising prowess and blooming establishment support have impressed Washington insiders. But his strengths have yet to be tested in the wilds of the campaign trail, where goodwill for Romney still lingers among rank-and-file Republicans. Bush will have to introduce himself to Republican voters, hold steady throughout the ups-and-downs primary grindhouse and explain thorny positions to a GOP electorate that has drifted right since Bush last held office almost a decade ago. At some point in the coming months, Bush will have to show some more leg to the public. In Iowa, Branstad said he spoke to Bush about coming to an Agriculture Summit for presidential candidate in March. Bush, he said, “has some real interest in that.” “My advice to all the candidates is come early and come often,” Branstad said. “I hope he does.”",10517,Peter Hamby,0.031,0.873,0.096,0.9991

Mike Pence is expanding Medicaid – with a few conservative changes he’s touting as big reforms to the program. The potential Republican 2016 presidential candidate announced his decision to embrace the Medicaid expansion included in President Barack Obama’s health care law in a speech Tuesday morning. It’ll make health coverage available to 350,000 more Hoosiers starting Feb. 1, he said. He joins Ohio Gov. John Kasich on the list of GOP 2016 possibilities who have expanded health coverage through Obamacare. Some of the party’s governors touted as potential vice presidential possibilities, including New Mexico’s Susana Martinez, have done so, as well. The decision immediately pleased hospitals and many Democrats in Indiana, but has opened Pence up to attacks from a Republican base – as well as conservative groups like Americans for Prosperity, typically a strong ally – that sees his reforms as merely window dressing for an embrace of Obamacare. Trying to stave off that criticism, Pence called his plan “a proven model for Medicaid reform across the nation.” He’s even renaming it, calling his expansion the “Healthy Indiana Plan 2.0” rather than Medicaid. It’s an update on an insurance program first launched through a federal Medicaid waiver under Pence’s predecessor, former Gov. Mitch Daniels. The key differences: The Healthy Indiana Plan requires small individual contributions to health savings accounts, as well as a co-pay for emergency room visits. It also offers participants assistance buying private insurance. The program had until recently covered just 40,000 Hoosiers, funded through a state cigarette tax hike, but it had drawn rave reviews from users. It’s not clear whether Pence’s version can shave costs off a Medicaid program that conservatives have long called too costly. “Since the beginning of my administration, we have worked hard to ensure that low-income Hoosiers have access to a health care plan that empowers them to take charge of their health and prepares them to move to private insurance as they improve their lives,” Pence said in a statement Tuesday. “This has been a long process, but real reform takes work.”",2176,Eric Bradner,0.051,0.846,0.102,0.9608

Speaking to an audience of students and activists in New Delhi, Obama declared the U.S. was India’s best-suited partner as it makes rapid economic advances and appears poised to overtake China to become the world’s most populous nation. But he didn’t veil his take on recent attacks against women here, urging the country away from violence against women and religious minorities. Recent rapes in India have put harsh focus on India’s gender politics. “Every girl’s life matters,” Obama said in New Delhi. “Every daughter deserves the same chance as our sons. And every woman should be able to go about her day—to walk the street, or ride the bus—and be safe and be treated with the respect and dignity that she deserves.” Sexual assaults became a high-profile problem in India after a young woman was gang-raped on a bus in New Delhi in 2012. The victim later died. Subsequent incidents of sexual violence — including at the hands of an Uber driver — placed global scrutiny on India’s laws and culture. Obama traveled to India in the hopes of capitalizing on the deep personal warmth he’s quickly developed with the new Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, whose effervescent welcome for the American president was covered enthusiastically and exhaustively by Indian media. That’s a distant cry from Modi’s arrival in the United States in September, which was marred by awkward questions over his visa status. Modi, a member of the right wing Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party, had previously been denied entry to the U.S. for an alleged role in a massacre of Muslims. Obama said on Tuesday it was the responsibility of every citizen to uphold the freedom of religious that’s enshrined in India’s constitution. “Every person has the right to practice their faith how they choose, or to practice no faith at all, and to do so free from persecution and fear,” Obama said. Obama’s parting speech Tuesday was one of his few moments apart from Modi during his stay in India. The pair hugged upon Obama’s arrival, sipped tea and meandered through a formal garden, and sat for hours behind rain-splattered bulletproof glass reviewing the annual Republic Day parade. White House officials say the level of personal interaction between the leaders exceeded even their already-high expectations, and claim the relationship greased the way for progress on a civilian nuclear deal to allow U.S. firms to construct power plants in India. Both sides also moved toward more defense cooperation and trade pacts. But despite their talk of cooperation, obvious differences persist between the U.S. and India that could preclude cooperation on areas like combating climate change. During his remarks Tuesday, Obama said India must commit to reducing emissions that cause climate change, even as the manufacturing and power plants that produce that pollution drive India to new economic heights. “Here’s the truth: even if countries like the United States curb our emissions, if growing countries like India—with soaring energy needs—don’t also embrace cleaner fuels, then we don’t stand a chance against climate change,” Obama said.",3402,Kevin Liptak,0.086,0.754,0.159,0.9927

READ: Keystone debate ends with Democrats’ ire Democrats who voted against moving to a final vote on the bill said they were frustrated Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell prevented debate and votes on amendments during a tense late-night session on Thursday that short-circuited what otherwise appeared to be actual bipartisan progress on the contentious issue. “I’m very disappointed,” Sen. Tom Carper, D-Delaware, a Keystone supporter, said as he headed to the floor to vote no. “I’m still not sure why that happened.” The vote was significant for Democrats who pointed to it as proof Republicans will need to reach across the aisle to get things done. “Sen. McConnell promised Democrats an open amendment process and a full-throated debate on the Keystone pipeline and we are holding him to that promise,” said Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-New York, a Keystone opponent. “Trying to muzzle the debate by refusing to allow Democrats even one minute to advocate for their amendment and then simply refusing to hold votes on dozens of amendments is not remotely an open process.” Republicans saw it differently. They pointed to the more than two dozen votes on amendments from both parties as evidence they are running a much more accommodating Senate than the one they faced when they were in the minority for the last several years. “We’ve had a lot of floor discussion. We’ve considered Democrat and Republican amendments,” McConnell said before the vote. “I’m calling on all of my colleagues – especially the co-sponsors of this bipartisan bill, especially those who’ve supported Keystone without any amendments in the past – to vote for jobs and progress tonight, not the kind of gridlock American voters just rejected so emphatically,” he said.

It was an opening salvo in what is surely going to be an ugly battle to get the politically-sensitive agency funded before it runs out of money on Feb. 27. READ: GOP immigration showdown looms “As we rapidly approach the date on which the Department of Homeland Security’s funding expires, and as law enforcement officials face major threats to our nation’s safety and security, we write with one simple request:  work with us to pass a clean bill that funds Homeland Security for the remainder of the fiscal year,” said a letter to McConnell that was signed by all Senate Democrats. McConnell announced on Tuesday the Senate would turn to the DHS funding bill once it wraps up a bill to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, which could be later this week or early next week. Republicans will need support from at least six Democrats to pass the House DHS bill – the letter signals that will be hard to get unless the riders are removed. “The House bill cannot pass the Senate,” the Democrats wrote. At issue are two amendments the House approved when it passed its bill earlier this month.  One would block funding within DHS to carry out President Barack Obama’s recent executive orders on immigration that would allow millions of immigrants who are in the U.S illegally to stay. The second would roll back the Obama’s 2012 Deferred Action on Childhood Arrivals order that allowed so-called “Dreamers” to stay in the country. SEE ALSO: Boehner opens door to Obama immigration lawsuit McConnell declined to say how he planned to get around the standoff. “All I can tell you right now is that we’re going to the DHS bill after we finish Keystone,” he said at a news conference. “The procedure by which we deal with that will be determined later.” The bill is a vexing problem for leaders of both parties. That’s because it’s unlikely Democrats can get the necessary 60 votes to strip out the added House amendments while Republicans are unlikely to get the 60 votes they need to pass the bill with them attached. A stalemate is possible. Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, a member of the GOP leadership said taking on the President’s immigration orders is “an important fight to have.” “I think we should do everything we can to persuade at least half a dozen Democrats that they should join us to get this done,” Blunt said. “Sometimes you don’t’ know how theses legislative battles go if you don’t have them, and we intend to have this one.” House Republicans also haven’t signaled what they will do if the bill their bill can’t pass the Senate. “There’s no reason for me to speculate on what we will or won’t do,” House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said at a news conference on Tuesday.",2926,Ted Barrett,0.058,0.882,0.059,0.1045

Bowe Bergdahl, the soldier who left his post in Afghanistan, and was captured and held by the Taliban for years before being exchanged last year for five detainees from Guantanamo Bay, but Pentagon officials are insisting no decision has been made as of Tuesday. The decision could come “very soon, imminently,” one senior defense official told CNN. The Pentagon issued a statement denying reports that it has determined to charge Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl with desertion over his disappearance from his post in Afghanistan. NBC News reported Tuesday that Bergdahl will be charged with desertion, following an interview that aired Monday night on Fox News, where a former military officer said he’s been told by sources that Bergdahl’s lawyer has been provided a list of the charges. Saying he wants to put a “fork” in reports about the fate of Bergdahl,  Pentagon Press Secretary Rear Admiral John Kirby said Tuesday that “no decision has been made” with respect to case. Kirby said there is no timeline to make that decisions and Gen. Mark Milley is not under any pressure to make a decision. “There is a process here,” Kirby said adding that Gen. Milley is still “in a deliberative process,” Kirby added that Bergdahl “has not been charged with any crime.” Maj. Gen. Ronald F. Lewis, The Chief of Public Affairs United States Army also said Tuesday, “The reporting from Fox News and NBC on Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is patently false,” referencing reports those outlets had saying that Bergdahl will be charged with desertion. “What they are reporting is untrue – there has been no update to what we provided in Dec. Investigation is still with [General Mark] Milley who will determine appropriate action – which ranges from no further action to convening a court martial. We cannot discuss or disclose the findings of the investigation while disciplinary decisions are pending before commanders,” the Army also said in a statement provided to CNN. Eugene Fidell, a member of Bergdahl’s legal team declined to comment to CNN. Several military sources tell CNN that as of Tuesday morning, Milley who is reviewing the case has not signed or forwarded a charge sheet. Milley has a full range of legal options he could decide upon ranging from no action, to charging Bergdhal with an offense such as desertion that could lead to a courts martial military officials say. Among the higher ranking officials, there is a good deal of discussion that Bergdahl could be facing a charge of desertion. “Our culture demands accountability, you can’t just say it didn’t happen,” one official told CNN. The official, who has some knowledge of the case, said “there is no malice in the Pentagon towards Bergdahl,” echoing a sentiment of others that regardless of the charge Bergdahl is unlikely to face jail time, given the years he already spent in Taliban captivity.

They’re everywhere. It is ironic that a drone could strike down near the White House – as one did Monday morning – since the issue of drone strikes is one that will follow President Barack Obama and mark his legacy. After the crash near his temporary home, Obama called during an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria for more drone regulation. “The drone that landed in the White House you buy in Radio Shack,” Obama said. But when historians talk in the future about drones and the Obama White House, they won’t  be referring to be the two-foot long quad copter that was discovered on the Southeast corner of the White House grounds  and sent Washington into a security-related lather early Monday morning, but rather to the unmanned aerial vehicles – the Pentagon calls them UAVs – like the one that was confirmed on Monday by the U.S. Government to have delivered its payload in Yemen. The strike acknowledged Monday is one of more than 500 that have been launched by the United States since 2011, according to data compiled by The New America Foundation. Three officials told CNN’s Barbara Starr about the drone strike in Marib, Yemen, which was conducted by the CIA. The agency declined to comment, although Starr reported that it is not believed any major AQAP leaders were targeted. This is the first U.S. drone strike of the year in Yemen and the first since a popular uprising in Yemen has destabilized the government that has so far cooperated with the U.S. In its anti-terror campaign. The New America Foundation has sought to keep a tally of U.S.-led drone strikes in Pakistan and Yemen. The use of drones peaked in Pakistan in 2010 and in Yemen in 2012, according to their data. It was in 2010 that the Department of Justice lawyers wrote a secret memo for the Obama administration that argued extra-judcial killings of people suspected of being terrorists was justified under U.S. Law, even in the case of U.S. citizens thought to be plotting abroad. That memo – or two thirds of it that were not redacted – were  released by a federal court last June in the face of a lawsuit by the ACLU. Clearly there’s a huge difference between the type of drone used by the military to target and kill suspected terrorists and the type of drone used to take video with a GoPro. Somewhere in between is the type of drone, also in the news, drug smugglers are now using to carrying drugs across the Southern border. Tijuana police said last week they intercpted a drone carrying six pounds of synthetic drug crystal meth that crashed into a super market parking lot because six pounds, worth about $48,000 according to the DEA, was too much weight for the drone to handle. A spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Patrol said U.S. authorities have not yet encountered a drone as part of the war on drugs. But they do use drones of their own to monitor traffic on the Southern border for undocumented crossings. In addition to drug smugglers, legitimate businesses want to use drones too. Farmers are using them. Jeff Bezos wants Amazon to use them, although it’s a little unclear how that’ll work out. Related: Amazon’s drone delivery: How would it work? Colin Guinn, who is CEO for 3D robotics, testified about research into the commercial use of drones Jan. 21 on Captiol Hill. He did so with a small drone, about the same size as the one that crashed near the White House, hovering next to him. There were snickers when the drone briefly crashed in the hearing room. All of this is in the way of saying drones are taking on an increased importance in the U.S. economy and becoming more visible in the nation’s airways. The Federal Aviation Administration has issued some guidelines restricting where and how users can fly drones, but the industry is largely unregulated as more companies look to buy and integrate the relatively new technology into their business. The FAA had set a September 2015 deadline to roll out a list of drone regulations. Obama noted the need for more regulation during his interview with CNN’s Zakaria. “You know that there are companies like Amazon that are talking about using small drones to deliver packages… There are incredibly useful functions that these drones can play in terms of farmers who are managing crops and conservationists who want to take stock of wildlife.” Obama said. “But we don’t really have any kind of regulatory structure at all for it.”",4497,Z.

But even as the U.S. works closely with the Saudis on common strategic goals like counterterrorism, Obama said he and his administration continue to apply “steady, consistent pressure” on issues like human rights. Obama is headed to Saudi Arabia to meet the new King Salman and pay his respects following the death of King Abdullah last week. “Sometimes we have to balance our need to speak to them about human rights issues with immediate concerns that we have in terms of countering terrorism or dealing with regional stability,” Obama said in an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria in India on Tuesday. During his visit Tuesday, Obama will make “paying respects,” the bigger priority, avoiding directly answering a question from Zakaria on whether Obama would discuss with the Saudis the case of the political activist and blogger who was sentenced to 20 years in prison and 1,000 lashes for his activism. RELATED: What to expect when Obama visits Saudi Arabia And Obama was candid that U.S. pressure to advance human rights or encourage political reforms isn’t always appreciated and “oftentimes that makes some of our allies uncomfortable. It makes them frustrated,” he said. “And you know, some of them listen and some don’t,” Obama said. In the list of those who don’t, Obama recalled the unraveling of the Egyptian dictatorship of Hosni Mubarak, the former president of Egypt who was overthrown in Egypt’s 2011 revolution. Mubarak was one of the U.S.’s closest allies in the region during his three decades in office, thanks in large part to a strong security agreement and Mubarak’s work to maintain peace with Israel. Obama said that he warned Mubarak that the massive protests in Tahrir Square were not simply going to vanish, urging Mubarak to “get out in front of reform” and become “the father of the Egyptian democracy.” “I said, ‘Mr. President, I don’t think this is a genie that you can put back in the bottle,’” Obama recalled. “He said, ‘Ah, Mr. President, you don’t understand society here.  This is all going to be fine.  It’ll blow over.’ And it didn’t,” Obama said. “But the trendline is one that I will sustain throughout the rest of my presidency and that is to make an argument to those friends and allies of ours that if they want a society that is going to be able to sustain itself in this age, then they’re going to have to change how they do business,” Obama said.",2615,Jeremy Diamond,0.076,0.832,0.092,0.8765

Attorney General Scott Pruitt said that he thought the Supreme Court will ultimately uphold the constitutionality of the protocol, but that while the case is under consideration, he would ask the justices to grant a stay of the executions. “The families of the victims in these three cases have waited a combined 48 years for the sentences of these heinous crimes to be carried out,” Pruitt said, but he added that the State has an obligation to “ensure justice in each and every case.” At issue before the court is the efficacy of one of the drugs, midazolam, used in Oklahoma’s three drug protocol.

Nine months ago Oklahoma botched the execution of death row Clayton Lockett using the same protocol.

172,172,01/26/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/26/politics/rubio-cruz-paul-event/index.html,Cruz-Paul-Rubio event previews GOP foreign policy debate,Politics,CNN,"Three likely presidential candidates shared the stage Sunday night before a roomful of wealthy donors, engaging in a rapid-fire policy discussion that underscored sharp disagreement within the GOP over global affairs and national security. Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul took part in a largely friendly, but occasionally fiery, panel at the Palm Springs event sponsored by mega GOP donors David and Charles Koch, better known as the Koch Brothers. The event, moderated by ABC’s Jonathan Karl, marked the first time potential GOP contenders gathered on the same stage at the same time to talk about policy in 2015, a year that’s expected to see a hoard of candidates compete for the Republican nomination in forums and debates. RELATED: 2016 race kicks off with auditions in Iowa It also offered a window into the unofficial campaign that’s largely playing out behind the scenes, with White House hopefuls traveling the country and meeting privately with donors — in settings much like the California desert Sunday — to gauge the kind of the financial commitments they could secure for a 2016 endeavor. The first-term senators were keenly aware of their immediate audience — at one point Cruz blatantly said, “I admire Charles and David Koch” — but knowing their remarks would be public, they also sought to show off their command of the issues in a high-pressure scenario. The senators revealed little disparity on domestic and economic policies, but roughly half way into the event, the discussion shifted toward President Barack Obama’s new Cuba policy — and Paul instantly found himself on defense. “I’m kind of surrounded on this,” Paul joked. Rubio and Cruz both have parents who emigrated from Cuba, and Paul is also the odd-man-out on substance, being the only one on stage who’s backed the President’s call for relaxing the Cuba embargo. The Kentucky Republican explained that in hindsight, President Richard Nixon “made the right decision” by opening relations with China, saying it prevented war and opened up trade. “China not a good example,” Rubio disagreed, saying the country may be “more prosperous…but it is not a free country.” That launched the two into a deeper debate over whether the U.S. should place sanctions against all countries with a record of human rights violations. “I’m not a big fan of a lot of these regimes but I don’t want to isolate ourselves and not trade with people who aren’t perfect,” Paul said. His answer was also a masked response to critics who label him an isolationist due to his push for less intervention abroad. Rubio, answering Paul, stressed that Cuba stands out because of its close proximity to the U.S. “The difference is that Cuba’s 90 miles from our shores,” Rubio said. “What happens there we will feel immediately.” The negotiations with Iran over its nuclear weapons program also became a major flash point on the panel. Paul is supporting Obama’s push to avoid imposing sanctions against Iran while the negotiations are still ongoing. “Diplomacy is a good thing, not a bad thing,” Paul said. His argument, however, failed to generate much excitement in the room. That’s when Rubio swooped in to warn that the U.S. is dealing with a country that’s run by someone whose mission is “to bring the whole world under the flag of Islam.” “So I am a little cautious…about negotiating with someone who has openly said he wants to force all of us to either be like him or die,” he said, generating a strong response from the audience. Cruz also won heavy applause when he underlined the threat of Islamic extremism, declaring that a nuclear Iran would be the single biggest threat to the U.S. and argued Ayatollah Khomeini and the country’s leaders are “radical religious Islamic nutcases” who “glorify death or suicide.” Combating Islamic extremism was a common theme Saturday when potential candidates, including Cruz, took turns speaking at a marathon event in Iowa, where attacks on Obama’s foreign policy, in particular with regard to ISIS, stirred some of the loudest responses from the audience. Each of the senators delivered an impressive grasp of the issues, firing off statistics on a wide range of topics and punctuating their positions with personal stories that touched on their own background. But it was Rubio who commanded the most time, delivering fast-paced but forceful answers. He jumped first at questions and frequently sat on the edge of his seat as he would crescendo into some of his more impassioned arguments, like on Cuba or Iran. Style-wise, Rubio sported a suit and looked the part of his day job, while Paul donned a navy sport coat with blue jeans, and Cruz wore the same tan colored coat he wore to a conservative event in Iowa the day prior. Rubio, who has already said he won’t run for re-election to his Senate seat in 2016 if he runs for president, held the middle seat of three seats and drew frequent laugh lines in addition to applause. When Karl asked if the super wealthy have too much influence on elections, Rubio made the audience roar when he quickly rattled off a snarky response that both validated his audience and took a shot at the left. “As opposed to Hollywood or the mainstream media, you mean?” While all three men praised Mitt Romney on a personal level, none expressed any faith that the 2012 GOP nominee would be successful in another bid at the White House. Paul said Romney would have been a better president than Obama, but when asked if a revised Romney campaign would fare better in 2016, the Kentucky Republican joked: “I’m kind of with Ann Romney on this one ‘No. No. No. No. Never’.” (It was actually Mitt, not his wife Ann, who repeated the word “no” 11 times to the New York Times last year when asked if he planned to run again) The next nominee, Paul argued, needs to be someone who can “reach out and appeal to new constituencies,” and he questioned whether the millionaire with a long history in politics would be able to strike that “visceral connection” with “enough people to win a general election.” For his part, Cruz used Romney’s infamous comments about nearly half the country being dependent on government to illustrate his case against the 2012 nominee. “The reason Republicans lost can be summed up in two words: Forty-seven percent,” the Texas Republican said. “I don’t just mean Mitt Romney’s comments that were caught on tape… the central narrative of the last election, what the voters heard, was we don’t have to worry about the 47%.” “I think Republicans are and should be the party of the 47%,” he added, seeking to drive home a message about the GOP needing improve its standing with middle class voters. Things certainly grew tense when the discussion focused on foreign policy, but the men didn’t deliver any blows or direct attacks against each other on stage. In fact, Cruz tried to round out the event with a glowing tribute to his soon-to-be rivals. The senator, who was elected in 2012, pointed out that both Rubio and Paul mounted long-shot Senate bids in 2010 and won despite facing establishment money and resources. “All of the money in their state was against them, and they ran campaigns that inspired me, inspired me to run,” said Cruz, who also won an underdog campaign. Instead, knowing it’s never a bad idea for Republicans to attack the media, they directed any confrontational tones towards Karl for trying to get the men to give “yes or no” answers. “When and if any of these people run for president, there should be an absolute rule: no ‘yes or no’ questions,” Paul said to the moderator, drawing applause from the audience and getting a “here, here” from one of his colleagues on stage.",7676,Ashley Killough,0.076,0.811,0.113,0.9954
173,173,01/26/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/26/politics/iran-sanctions-negotiations-explainer/index.html,Why the Iran sanctions fight is a big deal,Politics,CNN,"President Barack Obama delivered a bold and blunt message during his State of the Union address to members of Congress looking to hang new sanctions over Iran’s head: Keep. Out. It’s a message world leaders and diplomats working with the U.S. to wrangle Iran into relinquishing its nuclear weapons program have echoed. But none of that is stopping sanctions advocates in the Senate, who will mark up their latest piece of legislation in committee this week, bringing the bill one step closer to action on the Senate floor. READ: What’s happening in the Middle East and why it matters And as negotiators rebooted talks with Iran in Geneva, Sen. Robert Menendez, the lead Democratic sponsor of the sanctions bill, accused the White House of peddling talking points “straight out of Tehran.” Throw Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s upcoming visit into the mix, a couple veto threats, and you’ve got a bona fide Washington showdown. Why does this all sound so familiar? Because it is. Congressional Republicans and a dozen Democrats, bolstered by the powerhouse pro-Israel lobby AIPAC, faced off against the White House and dozens of pro-peace groups last year when they tried passing the a sanctions bill. The bill earned on-the-record support from 60 senators – just enough to override a filibuster – but the bill never got a vote after the White House issued a veto threat and went on a lobbying spree urging Democrats to oppose it. What’s different now? The November midterm election changed the dynamics – Republicans snagged the Senate majority and Iran sanctions were suddenly back on the table, handing advocates a pretty easy path to 60 votes and even a chance of reaching a veto-proof majority. SEE ALSO: Obama hates the new Iran sanctions bill Menendez and his Republican counterpart, Sen. Mark Kirk of Illinois, got to work on changing their bill to make it more palatable to Democrats. Obama, though, rushed to issue a new veto threat even before the new draft legislation even went public. How did they change the bill, and why does Obama still hate it? Last year’s bill would have crashed right onto the negotiating table where Iran and delegations from six countries were haggling over its nuclear program, immediately dropping new sanctions on Iran and likely killing the talks. Senate staffers and their bosses have stripped away the most divisive provisions, though stronger language could always get added to the new, watered-down bill as it winds its way through the legislative process. But even in its current form, Obama is urging Congress to stand down. Negotiators argue any measure from Congress would threaten to unravel the fragile international coalition they believe is the world’s best shot at peacefully ending Iran’s nuclear program. The Iranians could feel like threatened or bullied by sanctions legislation, prompting them to ditch the negotiating table. And then, they can blame the U.S. Congress for undoing a potential deal – a blame game many countries would buy. Obama also counters that If talks break down, he will swiftly impose new sanctions on Iran – sanctions he could quickly get Congress to vote and pass. World leaders are also siding with Obama – British Prime Minister David Cameron even pounded out phone calls to a slew of senators during his trip to Washington last week, in an unusual move from a foreign leader. What’s Congress’ deal? Why are they pushing sanctions? Even though there haven’t been any new sanctions, Iran is already under increased economic strain as oil prices have plummeted in recent months and no one is expecting them to rise anytime soon. But the sanctions sticklers say the threat of new sanctions will pin Iran against a wall and force them to deal in good faith. RELATED: Corker says Obama ‘irresponsible’ with Congress The Iranian economy is still struggling, but has been making strides, experiencing some economic growth and lowering inflation after facing a recession. While the Obama administration had argued that sanctions relief would have a minimal impact, the IMF assessed in its 2014 report that the sanctions relief helped Iran stabilize its oil exports and gain access to funds held abroad. Kirk and Menendez say they want to strengthen the hand of negotiators and promise that the threat of new sanctions will do just that. Sanctions got the Iranians to the negotiating table in the first place and Iran’s only going to agree to a deal that actually rolls back its nuclear program for good if it’s under serious pressure, they argue. Sounds logical. But is there another side to this? The pro-sanction side had also been accused of having no faith in a negotiated solution and pushing the U.S. to the brink of war by sabotaging negotiations. While leading advocates like Kirk, Menendez and Democratic heavyweight Sen. Chuck Schumer refute those claims, others don’t shy away from that characterization. Freshman Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Arkansas, a member of the intelligence and armed services committees, boldly stated this month that the goal of a sanctions bill was to kill the negotiations he believes are leading nowhere. “The end of these negotiations isn’t an unintended consequence of congressional action. It is very much an intended consequence – a feature, not a bug,” Cotton said, calling for “immediate” and “crippling” sanctions. Sounds familiar … Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has also argued that a negotiated solution with Iran is impossible. He accepted congressional Republicans’ invitation to address Congress this spring over the Iranian threat. That sent the White House into a topspin: Netanyahu not only scheduled a speech to Congress that is expected to fly in the face of Obama’s diplomatic efforts, but the announcement of Netanyahu’s speech also came without any prior outreach to the White House. So what happens if talks actually collapse? If talks fall apart, the U.S. and the international community would lose the access it’s gained to monitor most of Iran’s nuclear facilities and Iran would no longer be constrained to a uranium enrichment threshold, as it has under the terms of the current negotiations. That’s why many argue that even if negotiations don’t result in a deal, the status quo is better than the alternative. Failed talks would send Iran’s nuclear program underground, so to speak, and sound alarm bells in Israel, the U.S. and other Western countries. Israel has already made clear it’s willing to do anything it takes to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon and promised to act unilaterally if necessary. Obama has insisted the U.S. would not be on an “immediate war footing” if negotiations fail, but he and other U.S. leaders have said nuclear Iran isn’t an option. And Saudi Arabia and its Gulf neighbors also won’t stand idly by if their top geopolitical foe works to attain a nuclear bomb. So the stakes are pretty high. Are there any alternatives? A couple. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, the new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is crafting a bill that would give Congress oversight power over an eventual agreement with Iran. Some in the Senate are starting to view it as an alternative to the sanctions bill. While Corker’s proposal hasn’t faced the same forceful opposition from the White House, the Obama administration would rather have Congress as far away as possible from the sensitive negotiations. Also in the works: an alternative sanctions bill being crafted by Sen. Barbara Boxer, a leading progressive, and conservative Sen. Rand Paul, which could be the only bill ultimately endorsed by the White House. It’s unlikely Boxer, who has consistently opposed sanctions efforts, would push a bill the White House isn’t on board with. Drafts of those two bills have yet to go public, but the Corker effort in particular is starting to draw support and could split Republicans looking to bolster the negotiations. So what’s the next step? The Senate Banking Committee is holding a hearing on Tuesday and then will review the Kirk-Menendez sanctions measure on Thursday. But this is one fight that will push on for weeks – with no clear outcome in sight.",8157,Jeremy Diamond,0.112,0.797,0.091,-0.9905

On Sunday, President Barack Obama announced plans for the Interior Department to designate 12 million acres of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, including its coastal plains, for conservation. The possibility of such a move has been the cause of a lengthy battle between environmentalists and the energy industry for some time. READ: Netanyahu visit continues to stir emotion Though his administration could take some steps immediately, the plan would need the approval of Congress – which Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee Chairwoman Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, made clear won’t be happening. She called the Obama administration’s move a “stunning attack” on Alaska’s economy. “It’s clear this administration does not care about us, and sees us as nothing but a territory,” Murkowski said in a statement. “I cannot understand why this administration is willing to negotiate with Iran, but not Alaska,” she said. “But we will not be run over like this. We will fight back with every resource at our disposal.” In a video posted on Sunday, Obama said his administration will set the land aside for conservation – and that he’ll ask lawmakers to give the region the United States’ highest designation for land protection. “I’m going to be calling on Congress to make sure that they take it one step further, designating it as a wilderness so that we can make sure that this amazing wonder is preserved for future generations,” he said. But Alaskan leaders said they’re angry about the plan to protect a land that’s important to bird, caribou and polar bear populations, with independent Gov. Bill Walker saying he could speed up state land leasing for oil exploration as a result. Murkowski, as the Senate’s energy chairwoman, is best positioned to fight Obama’s proposal on Capitol Hill. But other Alaska Republican lawmakers criticized the administration’s move, too.

The pair have “chemistry,” according to the White House and Indian officials. They’ve shared impromptu strolls on the National Mall and, on Sunday, a long meander through a New Delhi rose garden. Indian weavers are hurriedly piecing together saris as gifts for the first lady. The normally congested Indian capital has been rid of its stray monkeys – at least in the places Obama might visit. And local television networks are running entire pieces speculating the two leaders might take a selfie. Here’s a highlight reel of social media’s favorite Obama and Modi broments so far: In case anyone doubted the deep bond between Obama and Modi (and how could they?), Air Force One’s arrival on Sunday put any questions to rest. Breaking with established protocol – and surprising television commentators on the dozen or so local news broadcasters – Modi showed up on the tarmac to be the first to greet Obama in India. And it wasn’t just with a handshake. Modi pulled the travel-weary commander in chief for the “bear hug” seen around the world – though like most unplanned hugs in front of a billion-viewer television audience, it was a little awkward. The two leaders later followed it up with another warm embrace after a joint press conference, stoking rumors of a “bromance.” When Modi visited Obama at the White House in September, the visit ended with Obama blowing up his set-in-stone schedule and taking the visiting Prime Minister for a stroll at the Martin Luther King memorial on the National Mall. The strolling continued in New Delhi. Obama and Modi, punctuating their bilateral talks, sauntered side by side through the formal gardens at Hyderabad House, a stately 1920s home that now acts as a ceremonial venue. Cameras caught them murmuring away to each other, but reporters could not hear what they said. After the stroll they sat down for a cup of tea. Modi’s camp wasted no time posting a Facebook album of highlights. When Obama and Modi last sat down for dinner, at the White House in September, only one of them actually ate. Modi was midway through a religious fast that allowed only warm water. This time around, solid foods were consumed by all. A readout of lunch showed vegetarian and nonvegetarian menus, each with more than a dozen dishes. (Even so, Indian celebrity chef Saransh Goila criticized its lack of variety.) Dinner was an even bigger affair: Held at the presidential palace, the event featured Indian dancers, a receiving line and, of course, a pair of heartfelt toasts. India and the U.S. share the “natural sense of kinship” their leaders enjoy, Modi said. Obama went with a passage from Walt Whitman’s “Passage to India”: “The earth to be spann’d, connected by network, / The people to become brothers and sisters.” “Here, in our time, these words have come to pass,” Obama said. The leaders poked fun at each other throughout the day. During a press conference, Obama remarked that Modi was greeted like a “Bollywood star” when he visited New York’s Madison Square Garden last year. Obama also said they compared how much sleep they’re getting, prompting polite laughter from the press corps. “And it turns out that Modi is getting even less sleep than me. But of course that’s because he’s still new. After you’ve been doing this for about six years, maybe he’ll be able to get an extra hour.” Not everyone was impressed with his answer, however.

We have a thing called the Constitution, and the Constitution doesn’t allow the chief executive just to make up law,” he said. Huckabee’s comments came as he defended state policies that allow undocumented immigrants known as “Dreamers” to qualify for in-state college tuition – and as he explores a run for president. The former Arkansas governor, Fox News host and winner of the 2008 Iowa caucuses said he won’t announce a decision on running for the White House until the spring, but added: “I think it’s pretty evident that I’m moving in that direction.” He spent Saturday at a conservative summit hosted by Iowa Rep. Steve King, the anti-immigration firebrand, which was attended by several top GOP 2016 hopefuls.

Since then, though, the party has shifted to the right, blasting Obama for his handling of border security and saying his executive actions on immigration have spoiled all chances of moving an immigration reform bill through Congress.",1928,Eric Bradner,0.022,0.866,0.112,0.9822
178,178,01/25/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/24/politics/obama-india/index.html,"On high-profile India visit, Obama says progress made on nuclear sticking point",Politics,CNN,"The leaders of India and the United States, testing the diplomatic extent of their personal friendship, said on Sunday they’d made progress on a deal allowing U.S. firms to cooperate on civilian nuclear power plants in India. U.S. companies are reluctant to construct nuclear plants in India if they aren’t shielded from liability after accidents, an assurance Indian lawmakers have been unwilling to extend. President Barack Obama and Prime Minister Narendra Modi stopped short of announcing a full-fledged deal but did say they’d moved forward on the issue. “This is an important step that shows how we can work together to elevate our relationship,” Obama said during a press conference that came after bilateral talks with Modi. Obama touched down in India on Sunday for a truncated state visit that has officials claiming a new era in U.S.-India relations is dawning. Obama hopes to capitalize on his young friendship with Modi to achieve diplomatic progress on climate, defense and trade – progress that has eluded U.S. leaders in the past. In a surprise break in protocol, Modi greeted Obama on the tarmac on his arrival in New Delhi and wrapped him in a hug. After a two-leg, 16-hour journey, Air Force One landed in New Delhi under midmorning fog around 10 a.m. (11:30 p.m. Saturday ET). The overcast Indian capital was heavily fortified with extra security for the President’s trip; police and military guards armed with machine guns patrolled roads and manned checkpoints throughout the city. Highways were shut well ahead of Obama’s arrival. The normally chaotic traffic scene was unusually serene hours before Obama’s landing. Even the city’s stray dogs and monkeys were being herded away from the routes Obama’s motorcade was scheduled to drive. A formal military presentation greeted Obama at the Indian President’s residence, and Obama joined Modi to lay a wreath at a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi. On Monday, Obama will be the first U.S. leader to headline India’s annual Republic Day parade, a colorful military spectacle featuring marching bands, dancing and lots of heavy machinery rolling down the stately Rajpath Boulevard. The White House says the invitation to act as the parade’s honored guest came as a major shock and could open the way for new cooperation between New Delhi and Washington. Obama himself sees the invitation as a “transformational” moment for U.S.-India relations, according to his aides. “I think it goes without saying that this is a seminal moment in the bilateral relationship, and that the extension of this invitation by the Prime Minister really continues to set a different tone for our reinvigorated partnership,” said Phil Reiner, senior director for South Asia on Obama’s National Security Council staff. But even the parade itself will act as a reminder of the decades of sometimes tense relations between the two countries. A military demonstration at heart, the vehicles and equipment parading before Obama on Monday will be mostly Russian-made, a vestige of India’s stance during the Cold War. Russia remains India’s largest supplier of weapons, and while their share is steadily decreasing, Russian military imports still amount to three-quarters of India’s stockpile. With U.S.-Russia relations worsening to Cold War levels, Obama hopes to balance Moscow’s influence in India during his visit this week. Officials also hope to exact climate commitments in New Delhi, where air quality warnings remained in place even during Obama’s visit. That’s a contrast to Obama’s trip late last year to Beijing, where roads were cleared and the air cleansed of its usual smog ahead of the President’s arrival. In China, Obama was able to secure historic carbon reduction promises from the new Premier there, though expectations for similar achievements in India were more measured. Indians working in the capital city on Sunday said they regarded Obama’s visit as a highly symbolic gesture from the United States – one they said was well-received, despite the security headaches that his arrival caused. Local television networks profiled weavers preparing elaborate gold-threaded saris for first lady Michelle Obama, who is accompanying her husband for the three-day state visit. The pair had planned to visit the Taj Mahal in Agra, whose origins as a memorial to a Mughal emperor’s wife have made it a romantic draw for couples. The side trip was nixed, however, so Obama and the first lady could fly to Riyadh to pay respects to the late Saudi King Abdullah.

179,179,01/25/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/24/politics/iowa-gop-2016-event/index.html,2016 race kicks off with long day of auditions in Iowa,Politics,CNN,"The 2016 Republican presidential race in Iowa got its unofficial start Saturday with a marathon of speeches, giving close to a dozen potential candidates a chance to introduce (or re-introduce) themselves to a core group of caucus-goers roughly one year before the contest. Immigration and Islamic extremism took front and center as the White House hopefuls sought to test-drive their stump speeches. On style, it was Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz who saw strong receptions from the audience, though support for a wide number of candidates was expressed in the hallways after the event. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also sought to establish a deeper bond with Iowa. The Hawkeye State receives outsized attention in presidential years thanks to its first-in-the-nation status during the primary season. Marathon time For the 10-hour day of back-to-back speeches, “the candidates” – as they were called –  joined other high-profile Republicans at Hoyt Sherman Place, an old, intricate theater built in 1877 that also became the first public art museum in Des Moines. Billed as the Iowa Freedom Summit, the event was co-hosted by Citizens United and Rep. Steve King, a revered lawmaker who represents the northwestern part of the state and has considerable clout among the more social conservative and Christian right faction of the party. It was no secret that it was considered a cattle call for the presidential race. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, for example, said that the reason he ended his Fox News show was for a bigger goal he has in mind. “It wasn’t just so I can go deer hunting every weekend, I can assure you that,” he said. Others were more blatant. “I am a potential presidential candidate, yes I am,” former Hewlett Packard CEO Carly Fiorina told CNN. Even Palin angled to get in on some of the action, teasing ahead of her appearance Saturday that she was now seriously considering a run. And real estate titan Donald Trump told reporters Saturday that he’ll make his decision before June. “I’m the one person who can make this country great again, that’s all I know,” he told reporters Saturday. “Nobody else can.” Palin, in her remarks, was less forward. Ticking through a somewhat dizzying and hard-to-follow speech, Palin suggested that the country is ready for a woman leader – just not Hillary Clinton. “Hey Iowa, can anyone stop Hillary?” she said, prompting the audience to cheer. “To borrow a phrase, yes we can!” The class of 2016 The speakers, who were typically allotted 20 minutes, used a bulk of their speeches to share their own personal upbringings. Ben Carson and Christie talked about their strict but sharp mothers, while Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Texas Sen. Ted Cruz talked about having pastors as fathers. Other more well-known names in Iowa — like former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum who won the state’s caucuses in 2012 and Huckabee, who won in 2008 — tried to remind Iowans why they picked them in the first place, dipping into their personalities but also focusing on the issues. Given King’s firebrand credentials as an outspoken opponent of illegal immigration, it was no surprise that problems at the border became a focal point in much of the speeches Saturday. Carson, a retired neurosurgeon, argued “there wouldn’t be people coming in here if there wasn’t a magnet pulling them in,” suggesting there should be criminal punishment for employers who hire undocumented workers. The main target in the immigration battle, however, was President Barack Obama’s executive action to delay deportation for up to five million undocumented immigrants. Or as Palin put it, in her folksy swagger, Obama’s decision makes him seem “like an overgrown little boy who’s just acting kinda spoiled.” Speakers railed against the President’s pledge to use his “pen and his phone” to work around Congress, with immigration as just one example of what many called the president’s “overreach.” That was punctuated when DREAM Act Coalition protesters interrupted Rick Perry’s speech, leading to one arrest and theater full of Iowans trying to drown out the demonstrators’ chants. The potential candidates also warned about what they see as a dire path for the country, in particular when it comes to foreign policy, a theme that, along with immigration, also seems poised to become a flash point in the 2016 presidential race, unlike in 2012. Santorum argued that the growth of ISIS is a consequence of the “isolationism” and “weakness” from the Obama’s administration. Cruz, like several speakers, said the President will fail in the war on terror if he refuses to use the words “radical Islamic terrorism.” Huckabee blasted Obama for devoting more time to climate change in the State of the Union address than talking about terrorism. “A beheading is a far greater threat to Americans than a sunburn,” Huckabee said. The issues There was plenty of the usual Iowa charm on stage, speeches with pig analogies and corn references. And there was more than one reference to how people in Iowa are somehow taller than average. Shown on a big screen above the stage was an image of a red barn sitting on a green hill surrounded by white fences. Steve King’s name — in all caps — was plastered across banners on the stage, as well as the podium. The contenders also dished out a bevy of red meat, blasting Obamacare, Common Core, the media, Hillary Clinton and the $18 trillion debt. Cruz won huge applause for proposing to place 110,000 IRS employees on the southern border, joking that they’ll do a better job at deterring illegal immigration than anything else. Giving a shout out to the state’s newly elected U.S. senator, Joni Ernst, was also a popular item on the agenda for the potential candidates. Nearly all of them referred to her as their “friend,” and almost equal amount of affection and time was dedicated to the state’s other beloved senator, Chuck Grassley. Walker, who, like Cruz, paced the stage back and forth as he spoke, delivered an impressive speech that honed in on his record as governor. He talked about implementing voter ID laws, and he painted himself as the valiant warrior who took on the public employees and won during the collective bargaining rights debate of 2011. He also didn’t forget to mention that he’s been elected three times in the past four years. Shortly after his speech, two men, both from Council Bluffs, talked outside about how they were wowed by Walker’s remarks. “If he could do on a nationwide scale what he did in Wisconsin, this country would be,” one man, Michael Patomson, started to say, before his friend, Bill Hartzell, interjected: “Transformed. The country would be transformed.” The reception Many attendees had a hard time picking just one favorite in the line of potential contenders. Several mentioned Fiorina as a surprise hit. “There was just a pantheon of people to listen to,” said Eric Rosenthal of Cedar Rapids. “Rick Perry was better than last time I heard him — that’s good. He needs it,” said Ernie Rudolph of Dallas County, Iowa. Christie also saw a warm reception and contested the idea that a Republican governor of a blue state who has a “Jersey guy” reputation will not connect with voters in Iowa. “That somehow I’m too loud, I’m too blunt and I’m too direct,” Christie said, dismissing the criticism as “conventional wisdom” from Washington pundits. “They’re wrong.” Still, he was noticeably different from his usual style. His demeanor was toned down and he read from his prepared remarks on the podium, a stark contrast to his preferred off-the-cuff method. Some of the chatter in the hallways and to reporters also featured two potential contenders who weren’t there: Jeb Bush and Mitt Romney. Trump put it simply: “Mitt had his chance. He should have won and he choked.” As for Bush: “We’ve had enough of the Bushes.” Sens. Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, as well as Gov. Bobby Jindal, also skipped the event, but given that it’s year ahead before Iowans start to caucus, it’s unlikely that missing one event will hurt them. Saturday’s event was more of a curtain raiser, giving the first glimpse of what will likely be a competitive Republican primary. Walker, as he closed his speech, offered a pledge that will likely be mirrored by several of the speakers on stage over the next year: “I’m going to come back many more times.”",8367,Ashley Killough,0.067,0.829,0.103,0.9933

U.S. military leadership has held open the possibility it would recommend moving advisers closer to combat lines. As the key Mosul battle looms, that remains a potential consideration  “if and when they believe it’s necessary,” a senior U.S. military official tells CNN. The possible recommendation would need to be approved by President Barack Obama, who has said that U.S. troops will not be sent on a combat mission. But putting advisers with front-line Iraqi troops puts American troops in close range of what is likely to be an intense battle with the terror group. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and Gen. Lloyd Austin, head of U.S. Central Command, would make that recommendation to Obama if they determine Iraqis need U.S. help and there is no other option for providing it. The official declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation but has direct knowledge of both generals’ thinking. The generals want to wait as long as possible to decide whether moving American ground troops closer to the front lines is necessary. Their hope is that Iraq will be able to field more experienced units perhaps as soon as this spring that can begin the Mosul assault, the official told CNN. Right now, the most experienced and loyal Iraqi units are protecting Baghdad. The Iraqis may need to be convinced to move them into the Mosul operation, and backfill with other units. Retaking Mosul from ISIS is considered one of the most important objectives of Iraq forces. This month, coalition airstrikes have stepped up around Mosul, in an effort to cut key ISIS supply lines into the city, as an opening move to a future assault. The U.S. military assessment is the soonest the assault could begin is spring. The anatomy of ISIS: How it is run Obama has been adamant that no U.S. troops will be put into direct ground combat in Iraq. In a speech to troops in September, Obama said, “The American forces that have been deployed to Iraq do not and will not have a combat mission. They will support Iraqi forces on the ground as they fight for their own country against these terrorists.” U.S. officials say 6,000 ISIS fighters killed in battles What Dempsey and Austin are holding open is the possibility of a small number of U.S. military troops working as advisers alongside Iraqi units involved in the upcoming Mosul assault in a front-line combat situation. Those troops could potentially also work on the ground to help Iraq units pick out targets to strike, if a recommendation is made and the mission approved. In September, Dempsey said he believed U.S. advisers on the front lines would not be needed. “But if it fails to be true, and if there are threats to the United States, then I of course would go back to the President and make a recommendation that may include the use of U.S. military ground forces.” In recent weeks, advisers have gone out in the field. What’s happening in the Middle East and why it matters Dempsey, for now, is strongly focusing on the pace of the Iraqi government meetings its goals first, according to the official. He still wants to see more progress on Iraq forming a unity government, proceeding with reconstruction goals and countering ISIS propaganda, the official said. “If we offer too much before Iraqis are ready, we are just painting over the rust,” the official said. Recent comments by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi that the coalition wasn’t doing enough to support Iraq only reinforced Dempsey’s view, the official said. And even working as advisers is risky for troops. Canadian forces in the field recently had to return fire when they came under attack during an advisory mission. As for ISIS’s current strength, the U.S. military assessment continues to be their momentum has been somewhat stalled in Iraq and territory gains in Syria are stagnant, the official said. The United States also believes ISIS is stepping up its terror tactics in both areas, including forcing people to fight, because they are having trouble recruiting and paying new fighters, the official said.",4186,Barbara Starr,0.121,0.791,0.088,-0.9804
181,181,01/24/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/24/politics/saudi-king-succession-washington/index.html,Washington sighs relief at Saudi succession,Politics,CNN,"Finally, something went right for the United States in the Middle East. Relief is palpable in Washington over the well-planned and seamlessly executed transfer of Saudi Arabia’s throne to King Salman bin Abdulaziz, 79, following the death of his 90-year-old half brother King Abdullah. The kingdom, despite signaling rare public dissent with the Obama administration over Iran and the Arab Spring, is a fulcrum of U.S. diplomacy in a region where Washington is struggling to adapt to dissolving national borders, chaotic change and sectarian carnage. Never mind that the U.S. is the world’s foremost democracy  and the transfer of power in Saudi Arabia was from one autocrat to the next. Saudi Arabia is crucial to U.S. goals on counter-terrorism, the campaign against ISIS and Al-Qaeda, the free flow of energy that sustains the global economy, as a counter-balance to Iran and as a sponsor of the long frustrated quest for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. In a sign of the kingdom’s importance to the United States, President Barack Obama made hurried plans to call in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday after his trip to India to pay his respects to Abdullah and his family and to meet with King Salman. Originally, Vice President Joe Biden was to have made the trip. The message from Washington is clearly : Long live the new king. The regal choreography in Riyadh is especially welcome to the White House as it contrasts with events just across the border in Yemen, another key ally where a US-backed government crucial to its anti-terror campaign has just been toppled to rebels supported by Iran. James B. Smith, who served as U.S. ambassador to Saudi Arabia between 2009 and 2013, said there should be no concern in the administration that Salman’s ascension will jeopardize U.S. relations with the deeply conservative kingdom. Lines of succession “We know Salman well, he was governor of Riyadh for the better part of 50 years, he is well known to the US government. I see no break in the U.S.-Saudi relationship,” Smith said. Salman vowed just hours after the death of Abdullah, that the kingdom “would continue adhering to the correct policies which Saudi Arabia has followed since its establishment.” State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said that the allies had a “long history of cooperation. We don’t have any indication that that cooperation will change.” Saudi watchers in Washington were impressed and reassured by the line of succession outlined by Salman in an apparent effort to solve a dynastic riddle and send a signal of continuity to the outside world. He named Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, one of scores of posssible candidates, as deputy crown prince, a move which puts him second in line to the throne and establishes a future transfer of power from the sons of the founder of Saudi Arabia, King Abdulaziz Ibn Saud, who have ruled the country since the 1950s, to a new generation. “I think for the near term, continuity is going to be the centerpiece here,” said Daniel Benjamin, a former coordinator for counter-terrorism at the State Department, now at Dartmouth College, told CNN. “There is now a member of the generation of the grandchildren who is second in line, he is a very close friend of the United States … so I think there is a lot of hope the relationship will stay on an even keel.” Prince Mohammed, now behind the King’s brother Prince Muqrin, 69,  in the line of succession, is a frequent visitor to the United States and has presided over Saudi Arabia’s anti-terrorism program. He narrowly escaped an assassination bid by Al-Qaeda in 2009. The succession plan was viewed as particularly important following unconfirmed reports that Salman has been in ill health himself, apparently having suffered a stroke. Tom Donilon, pointman for US relations with Saudi Arabia when he was Obama’s National Security Advisor, praised Abdullah as a “solid” ally who had ensured two decades of stability in the kingdom. He also said that the late King’s survivors had done a “pretty effective job of indicating stability with a quick annoncement with repect to succession, continuity of policy.” He told “The Lead” with CNN’s Jake Tapper that Mohammad, known as MBN in the United States was “a very, very competent person who is essential in terms of our joint efforts to combat terrorists.” Periods of tension Though there is relief at the apparent stability in Riyadh, relations between the United States and Saudi Arabia in recent years have have often been troubled. There was a tense period a decade ago, after it emerged that 15 of the 19 hijackers involved in the September 11 attacks originated from Saudi Arabia. Critics, including some in the U.S. government, faulted Saudis for backing jihadists movements throughout the region for geopolitical reasons. The Saudi government has also balked at U.S. criticisms of its human rights record and political system. Questions about Iran More recently, Saudi Arabia, the key Sunni power in the Middle East,  has not hesitated to make clear its concern about Obama’s quest to improve relations with its mighty Shia foe Iran, with which it is fighting various proxy struggles. Saudi leaders were dismayed to learn about a secret backchannel of talks between the administration and Iran which built on the election of “moderate” Iranian President Hassan Rouhani in 2013 to launch an effort at rapprochment between Tehran and Washington. ‘“I think that the concern remains among the Saudi leadership about an agreement that is going to be at their expense,” said David Ottaway, an author on Saudi Arabia and senior scholar at the Wilson Center. Some analysts believe that the Saudi government could react to what it would see as a bad nuclear deal between world powers and Iran – which left the Islamic Republic with some capacity to enrich uranium or produce plutonium – by looking to find its own nuclear capability – perhaps with assistance from Pakistan. Saudi princes took to the op-ed pages of US newspapers in 2013 in a highly unusual move to complain that a nuclear deal was a “dangerous gamble.” The Saudi government also made clear its deep anger with Obama’s last-minute decision not to launch planned air strikes on Syria to punish the Bashar al-Assad regime’s use of chemical weapons the same year. Saudi Arabia has also been frustrated at how long it has taken the United States to begin training opposition fighters in Syria. Anger at Obama comments on the Arab Spring The Saudi government also registered anger at the Obama administration’s embrace of Arab Spring uprisings, which led to the ouster of allies like Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Obama appeared to make an oblique reference to those differences in a statement honoring Abdullah on Thursday as a “steadfast and passionate” believer in US-Saudi relations as a force for stability. “As a leader, he was always candid and had the courage of his convictions,” Obama wrote. In recent years, the Obama administration has attempted to assuage Saudi fears. The US president made a visit to Riyadh last year, on a trip that was widely seen as an attempt to mend fences. Saudi Arabian pilots, reportedly including one of Salman’s sons, Prince Khaled, helped carry out the first air attacks on ISIS in Syria last year. Saudi Arabia also approved of Secretary of State John Kerry’s exhaustive but ultimately futile efforts to keep Israel and the Palestinians talking.  And White House spokesman Josh Earnest said that an underpinning of those efforts, an Arab Peace Plan framed by Abdullah would stand as his lasting memorial. Smith said that the relationship between Riyadh and Washington was now better than it had been earlier in the administration. “A key element of our relationship with the Saudis over the years has been transparency,  not always in public but we have done a good job in talking to each other,” he said. “When you leave your allies out of the conversation and they don’t understand your negotiating position or don’t understand how you are going to enforce an agreement. they are left to their own conclusions. “I think we are doing a lot better at that.”",8127,Stephen Collinson,0.053,0.873,0.075,0.9815
182,182,01/24/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/23/politics/obama-india-trip-modi/index.html,"In India, Obama looks to capitalize on new friendship",Politics,CNN,"On a sunny morning in September, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi arrived at the White House facing low expectations for renewed U.S.-India relations and awkward questions about his visa status in the United States. A few hours later, Modi was taking a previously unplanned tour of the Martin Luther King Jr. monument on the National Mall with President Barack Obama as his personal guide. READ: What didn’t make the State of the Union The quiet moment was a rare incident of spontaneity on Obama’s otherwise rigid daily agenda, and as the leaders gazed at the stone memorial in the midday sun, White House aides say a personal chemistry between the two men began to form. What came afterward was a surprise to everyone. At a November meeting of Asian leaders in Burma, the Indian prime minister delivered Obama an astounding request: become the first American president to headline India’s Republic Day parade. Obama agreed, and on Monday, he will stand alongside Modi to take in the colorful yearly spectacle marking the emergence of the world’s largest democracy. The invitation, Obama’s aides say, came as a shock - but also presented a diplomatic opening unseen between the two countries in decades. “It took us by some surprise,” said Ben Rhodes, the President’s deputy national security adviser. “I think (Obama) sees this as a potentially transitional, if not transformational, moment for the relationship.” SEE ALSO: Why Obama’s trip to my homeland is meaningful Obama’s objective when he lands in New Delhi on Sunday: translate the personal warmth he’s developing with India’s leader into diplomatic progress that’s eluded the United States in India before. “There’s a great affinity between the United States and India and our people, but there’s also a history that is complicated,” Rhodes said. Complicated is a mild way to describe the often tense relationship between the two countries, at odds on trade, climate and defense equipment for years. Analysts say most of those tensions are likely to persist, despite early efforts of Modi’s administration to foster closer bonds to the United States. Longstanding concerns in India about close U.S. relations to regional rival Pakistan have also persevered, even as Washington’s relationship with Islamabad soured after the raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound. With U.S. officials describing the relationship with Pakistan on the “uptick,” Indian worry is growing. “Concern in India about America’s continued support for Pakistan is growing to a level that I haven’t seen in well-over a decade,” said Rick Rossow, the Wadhwani Chair in U.S.-India Policy Studies at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, noting that the drawdown of U.S. troops in Afghanistan has led to fears among the Indian public that terrorists could cross through Pakistan and into India. Obama’s visit - the first time a president has traveled to India twice while in office - won’t allay those concerns completely. But his presence at the widely televised Republic Day military parade sends a unifying message, according to experts. RELATED: Netanyahu visit causes headaches at home and abroad “I think you will see the President and the Prime Minister make it a point to try to appeal to various kinds of symbolism and the President especially reach out and try to connect with the Indian public,” said Tanvi Madan, the director of  the India Project at The Brookings Institution. In the minds of U.S. and Indian officials, even small agreements can begin to amount to larger progress on developing a better relationship between the world’s two largest democracies. One area diplomats hope to make progress this week: India’s nuclear liability law, signed in 2010, that essentially prevents American firms from constructing plants in the country. Outside analysts say they expect some progress on easing the measure. On climate, the White House wants to secure carbon reduction commitments in the model of what Obama achieved in China late last year, though such aggressive commitments aren’t as likely on this trip, experts say. “We won’t see a China-style deal, partly because India has spent the last few months separating itself away from the Chinese position on this,” said Brookings’ Madan, suggesting agreements on clean energy may be more likely. Any major breakthrough with India would have been hard to imagine six months ago. Analysts and even some diplomats hadn’t seen huge potential for the Obama-Modi meeting in September, which was clouded by the hurdle of ensuring Modi would be allowed to enter the United States after being denied a visa a decade ago for alleged involvement in sectarian violence. That Obama is now flying to New Delhi at Modi’s invitation may be a signal of how quickly progress could be achieved on other, more substantive, fronts - if the U.S. President can capitalize on his new friendship. “What does the President of the United States want? Does he want a best friend, or does he want somebody that’s going to carry through on commitments?” said Rossow. “It’s clearly the latter.” OPINION: Is India getting nostalgic over Russia ties?",5127,Kevin Liptak,0.044,0.818,0.138,0.9979

The case, which is likely to be heard this term, was brought by inmates who claim the state protocol violates the Constitution’s prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment and could open a new chapter in the ongoing battle over the patchwork system of execution procedures in the United States. “Petitioners are pleased that the Supreme Court will review their case,” said Dale Baich, one of the attorneys representing the death row inmates. In a statement, Baich said that the protocol is “not capable of producing a humane execution, even if administered properly. ” An original plaintiff in the case, Charles F. Warner, was put to death last week. Another plaintiff, Richard E. Glossip, is set to die on January 29. It was just nine months ago that Oklahoma botched the execution of Clayton Lockett using the same protocol. Related: Botched lethal injection marks new front in battle over executions Botched Oklahoma execution haunts inmate as death nears But Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt defended the state’s lethal injection procedure in a statement Friday. “Oklahoma’s execution protocol has been affirmed as constitutional by two federal courts and has successfully been implemented in Oklahoma, as well as more than 10 similar executions in Florida,” he said. “We will continue to defend the constitutionality of this protocol in order to preserve DOC’s ability to proceed with the sentences that were given to each inmate by a jury of their peers.” In 2008 – in a case called Baze v. Rees – the court found Kentucky’s lethal injection protocol constitutional, but since then, as they struggle to locate lethal injection drugs, many states have changed their protocols and have experimented with different drugs. In court papers, Baich asked the justices to take up the case to “revisit Baze v. Rees because the lethal injection landscape has changed significantly in the last seven years.” “The time is right for the court to take a careful look at this important issue,” Baich said. Oklahoma uses  an intravenous injection of midazolam meant to cause unconsciousness, followed by rocuronium bromide, which works as a paralytic, and then potassium chloride that serves as a heart-stopping agent. Critics of Oklahoma’s protocol say that the first drug, midazolam, is not FDA approved as a general anesthetic. They say midazolam fails to maintain unconsciousness. Florida, Oklahoma, Alabama and Virginia use the same three-drug protocol that includes midazolam, according to Megan McCracken, a death penalty expert at U.C. Berkeley’s Boalt Hall School of Law.  Other states such as Ohio and Arizona have used the drug in a two-drug combination. Ohio recently abandoned the use Midazolam after the execution of Dennis McGuire. “What’s at issue here is the use of midazolam and whether it is at all appropriate for execution,” said McCracken. “There  have only been three executions where the prisoner was not paralyzed after the administration of mid and all three went horribly awry, raising serious concerns about the drug and whether it allow humane execution,” she said.",3265,Ariane de Vogue,0.104,0.845,0.05,-0.9876

Hillary Clinton, the presumed Democratic Party front-runner for the 2016 presidential nomination, doesn’t have her own Facebook page. Currently, when you search Hillary Clinton on Facebook, you get a “topics” page: This is a far cry from the official public figure pages that both Mitt Romney and Jeb Bush are operating: Yes, Hillary Clinton has a page for book “Hard Choices.” But that presumes all her Facebook activity is limited to the goal of selling books, which we can all bet isn’t quite true. “I am obviously thinking about it,” Clinton said of running for president in April at a marketing summit in San Francisco. Compared to the pool of possible 2016 contenders, Hillary Clinton’s book page (at the time of this writing) has 46,469 “likes.” Mitt Romney, on the other hand, amassed a significant fan base on Facebook during the 2012 election cycle, reaching more than 11 million “likes.” Recently, Romney’s activity on the page has spiked with speculation that me might take a third run for president in 2016. Since September, he’s posted everything from the ice bucket challenge with his former vice presidential nominee Rep. Paul Ryan, to behind-the-scenes Thanksgiving photos and family grandbaby announcements. He was also quick to provide his own State of the Union reaction and post about March for Life – signaling his return to the political conversation. Jeb Bush, who doesn’t have nearly the following of Romney but still higher than Clinton’s book page, falls at 150,876 “likes.” He, like Romney, is using both Instagram and Facebook to communicate his position on tax reform, State of the Union and promoting his Rise to Right PAC with a short native video. But how do Clinton, Romney and Bush stack up against each other in overall engagement on Facebook? According to data provided by Facebook, a snapshot of activity on Dec. 24, 2014, shows 11,377 people were talking about Hillary Clinton, with a total of 15,339 interactions: likes, comments and shares. Flash-forward to this week, Jan. 21, 2015, and 874,812 were talking about her, with a new total of 1, 472,100 interactions – an increase of more a million engaged users. Since declaring his interest to run in 2016, the conversation around Mitt Romney has skyrocketed, exceeding the engagement and interest in Clinton. A snapshot from Dec. 24, 2014, shows that only 1,658 people were talking about Romney on the platform. A later snapshot from Jan. 21, 2015, shows that more than a million people, 1,100,060, were talking about Romney. In just under a month, that’s an increase of 1,098,402 people talking about him. As for his engagement, the number of people posting, sharing and liking content related to Romney has also increased significantly, by a whooping 1,816,611 in that same time period. Bush has also experience an increase in Facebook chatter and interaction, but nothing compared to the numbers of Clinton and Romney. On Dec. 24, 2014, Bush experienced 8,493 interactions. By Jan. 21, 2015, his interactions had increased to 312,267 – a jump of 312,774. With a total 1.85 billion total Facebook users in the United States, it’s no question Facebook will play a key role in engaging users in 2016. But it also begs the question, if Clinton is serious about running, why hasn’t she developed her own Facebook fan page?",3335,Ashley Codianni,0.014,0.833,0.153,0.9979

Cuba is known to be among the world’s worst human rights offenders, frequently jailing political dissidents and restricting freedom of expression, according to Human Rights Watch. “The Cuban government continues to repress individuals and groups who criticize the government or call for basic human rights.

News Talk 980 CJME, a local radio station in Saskatoon, reported on Wednesday night that a security supervisor from the venue hosting Clinton said “approximately 65 agents” were in house to protect the former first lady.

A senior Republican strategist familiar with the plans, speaking only on condition of anonymity, confirmed that the sit-down was put in the books some time ago, “in the couple to several weeks range.” The source said the meeting, which was first reported by The New York Times on Wednesday, was requested by Bush as a gesture of respect for Romney’s leadership role in the party — much like a recent Bush-John McCain meeting that took place at Bush’s request. And now? “Well obviously Governor Romney has changed the dynamics,” the source said. Separately, two Romney sources and a senior Bush source confirmed that the meeting will take place. Bush was spotted Thursday morning by CBS News boarding a flight from Washington to Salt Lake City. Asked if it was true he’s meeting with Romney, Bush responded: “I like to ski. I can’t comment.” When he arrived in Salt Lake City, he was met by a crowd of reporters and supporters who followed him from the gate through the airport. One man approached Bush and handed him what looked like a business card. “I’m a Republican. I’m in the oil business. And I’m an actor,” the man said. “And I voted for your dad.” “Thank you,” Bush said, accepting the card as he continued to walk. Bush briefly signed autographs outside and was followed by the small flock until he got into an SUV. “Thank you, Mr. President,” one man shouted. The former Florida governor’s itinerary this week also includes a speech Friday in San Francisco at the National Automobile Dealers Association convention. Romney told a group of donors in New York on Jan. 9 that he was angling towards another run at the White House, less than a month after Bush jumped to Republican frontrunner status following his own announcement that he was actively exploring a bid. The Romney announcement shook the early 2016 pre-presidential campaign and sparked confusion and competition as both men were now courting similar donors and influential Republicans behind the scenes. Making the competition more tense was a new CBS News poll this week that showed nearly six in 10 Republicans want Romney to run for president, while 50% feel the same about Bush. One reporter at the airport in Utah asked if the meeting would be awkward. “No,” Bush replied flatly. At times, their paths have almost crossed. Romney spoke publicly at last week’s Republican National Committee meeting in San Diego, for example, while Bush was also in Southern California courting donors. Their circles are further overlapping as the two potential candidates start to staff up. CNN’s Mark Preston reported earlier this week that two of Romney’s former aides – Megan Sowards and Matt Gorman – are poised to play key roles in a potential Bush campaign. Ever since the prospect of a third Romney campaign became serious, Bush has played nice about his potential competitor. According to Bloomberg Politics, Bush praised the 2012 nominee at a private fundraiser Wednesday in Washington, saying he doesn’t expect he’ll need to wage ugly campaigns against his opponents to win a primary. Neither Bush nor Romney are scheduled so far to attend a major gathering of conservatives this weekend in Iowa. Nearly 10 prospective Republican candidates, including Gov. Chris Christie, will speak at the Iowa Freedom Summit in Des Moines on Saturday hosted by Citizens United and Rep. Steve King. While Bush’s absence has stoked speculation that the former governor might plan to leave the first-in-the-nation caucus state out of his campaign strategy, Bush called the state’s GOP chairman on Wednesday to assure him that he plans to make Iowa a priority, the Des Moines Register reported. “What I heard is a man that’s ready to come out and tackle the Hawkeye state,” Kaufmann said, though he noted that Bush stressed he’s still only considering a run and hasn’t become an official candidate.

The disturbing information comes from a Yemeni official, who told CNN on Wednesday that ISIS has a presence in at least three provinces in southern and central Yemen, and there is now a “real competition” between ISIS and the Yemen-based terror group al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, or AQAP. That competition manifested itself in a gun-battle between the two groups in Yemen’s eastern provinces last month, the same official said, though he did not have specifics on the casualties that resulted from that incident. CNN cannot independently confirm the claims. American officials do think ISIS is trying to recruit in Yemen. But one U.S. counter-terror official stressed the view that AQAP remains the dominant force there. The American intelligence view is that while there may be a smattering of ISIS loyalists among Sunni extremists in Yemen, they are likely “mid-level AQAP militants who are  sympathetic to ISIL’s vision but haven’t broken ranks.” According to some experts, ISIS may be seeking a foothold in the Middle East’s poorest country because of its historical importance. “Yemen is significant in Islam,” said Katherine Zimmerman, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. “It is a place where we’ve seen attacks against the United States. It also has been a major feeder for foreign fighters into Afghanistan, into Iraq, and now into Syria,” Zimmerman added, “There’s a recruiting pipeline that ISIS may try and tap into.” The Yemeni official who spoke to CNN said AQAP is still the dominant terrorist presence in Yemen, with “hundreds” of members, compared to “dozens” for ISIS. Still, he added, “there’s a new kid on the block.” As violence flares, 7 things to know about Yemen And ISIS may be using its financial strength to win over some of AQAP’s potential recruits. The Yemeni official told CNN that ISIS supporters are telling potential recruits they can fund operations better than AQAP can at the moment. U.S. officials have long expressed concerns about ISIS’ financial strength, which it derives from the export of stolen oil, ransom payments from hostages, criminal activities and foreign donors. For this reason, the U.S. Treasury Department has undertaken aggressive efforts to cut the group off from the international financial system. News of ISIS’ inroads in Yemen comes as violence is rippling through the capital of Sana’a, where government troops are fighting Houthi rebels that are taking control of government facilities. That violence is causing concern within the Obama administration, who count on the Yemeni administration as key allies in the Middle East. “Some institutions of government have broken down and are in trouble,” U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry conceded at a press conference on Wednesday. Still, Kerry emphasized that President Abed Rabbo Mansour Hadi remains in power, and U.S. personnel “are well protected.” The Yemeni official tells CNN his government has not noticed significant AQAP movement in Sana’a during this time, which is, he said, “surprising.” But AQAP’s top leaders are still actively plotting, the official said, and still have ambitions of attacking the west. “I think the target as we initially saw (from AQAP) is going to be the Europeans, simply because of their ease to get onto the continent,” said Kirk Lippold, former commander of the U.S.S. Cole. “But ultimately, their aim is the United States.” The U.S. intelligence community is actively working to track down AQAP’s leaders, according to a U.S. counterterrorism official. These leaders include founder Nasir al-Wuhayshi, and notorious bombmaker Ibrahim al-Asiri, the mastermind of both the Christmas Day underwear-bomb plot in 2009 and a more recent attempt to put bombs in printer cartridges. Nevertheless, the Yemeni official cautioned, given the pressure AQAP has been under in recent months, is is now engaging more in its “pre-2011” tactics of employing smaller cells, and dispersed operatives. Their main activities these days are targeted assassinations of Houthis, and Yemeni government and military officials, he added. But officials and analysts worry AQAP and ISIS competition in Yemen could create a dynamic wherein the groups compete to strike the U.S. first and hardest. “It could lead an attack against the U.S. embassy in Sa’ana, which is vulnerable,” said Zimmerman. “And it could also direct its attention northward to Saudi Arabia.” Al Qaeda set to benefit from Yemen takeover",4610,Brian Todd,0.115,0.788,0.097,-0.9571

Iran-backed rebels of the Shiite Houthi sect sparked alarm in Washington after seizing a presidential palace in the volatile Sunni-majority nation, in what officials called a coup. There are now signs that the rebels – which have been resistant to American anti-terror efforts despite a common antipathy to al Qaeda –  and the U.S.-backed government of President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi have agreed a deal to end the crisis. READ: Yemen takeover threatens downward sectarian spiral But the situation remains volatile and a reminder of how the intricate, shifting and treacherous tribal and sectarian divides of the Middle East often confound U.S. efforts to frame coherent anti-terror policy. Obama has spent much of his administration sponsoring a political transition designed to restore stability in Yemen and to cap the sectarianism that sustains al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP). Washington has offered counter-terrorism training to the government in the Yemeni capital Sanaa and has also mounted a campaign of drone strikes against key AQAP leaders. The group is regarded by U.S. officials as the most potent offspring of Osama bin Laden’s jihadist movement and has claimed responsibility for the attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo this month. AQAP also almost succeeded in bringing down a United States commercial jet over Detroit on Christmas Day 2009, and has tried to attack the U.S. mainland on at least two other occasions. The group’s potential was underlined in a video released on Wednesday in which a senior leader of AQAP in Yemen, Nasser bin Ali al-Ansi, said it was better for jihadists to wage war in their home nations, rather than fighting on the front lines in Syria. The message will alarm Western governments fearful that Muslim extremists radicalized at home or who have fought in Syria, Iraq or Yemen are plotting new attacks in the wake of the Paris carnage. RELATED: Yemeni government, rebels reach tentative agreement, source says CNN’s Brian Todd reported that meanwhile, ISIS – al Qaeda’s jihadist rival – was now also beginning to establish a presence in the country. Yemen, which borders the Red Sea and the strategically important Gulf of Aden – a major oil transit route – sits next to key U.S. allies, Saudi Arabia and Oman. But it is also important rhetorically for the Obama administration. In a speech in September on combating ISIS, Obama held up U.S. operations in Yemen as an example for a new anti-terror doctrine which does not rely on sending troops into dangerous foreign quagmires. “This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years,” Obama said. Obama vowed to use “force against anyone who threatens America’s core interests, but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order.” The obvious problem with that strategy is that it needs secure, powerful local partners to have a hope of working. In failed states like Syria and Yemen, those partners often do not exist, or are, like Hadi, are deeply vulnerable. Stephen Seche, a former career foreign service officer, who served as U.S. Ambassador to Yemen between 2007 and 2010, said the current situation was bad news for the White House. “The Hadi government has been a good partner of ours in the counter-terrorism arena,” he said. “If you move President Hadi from the equation, then I think all bets are off in many respects.” After fighting raged in the streets of Sanaa, and a U.S. diplomatic vehicle was caught in the crossfire, the Pentagon moved two ships within range of the country in case the State Department gives the order for an evacuation of the embassy. With memories of the raid by extremists on U.S. compounds in Benghazi on Sept. 11, 2012, which killed four Americans still haunting the administration, and fears of a hostage drama, no one wants to take chances. SEE ALSO: ISIS gaining ground in Yemen But the White House faces a tough decision as it seeks to preserve limited influence that it still has on the ground in Yemen. “If we were forced to close down in Sanaa, the embassy, this would be a major foreign policy defeat,” CNN intelligence analyst Robert Baer told Wolf Blitzer. “We need a government in that country to crack down on al Qaeda. You cannot do this from the air, or the National Security Agency [cannot just] intercept intelligence. “We need a strong central government – whether it is a Houthi one or an independent one.” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday that the safety of embassy personnel in Sanaa was a top priority. He also made clear that preserving anti-terror cooperation in Yemen was also vital. But the long-term U.S. diplomatic posture in Yemen is unclear. The fact that al Qaeda is a common enemy of Washington and the Houthis raises the intriguing suggestion of possible cooperation. But any tie up would likely be tacit and covert, and Washington would have trouble publicly recognizing any Houthi regime. Mohammed Albasha, a spokesman for the Yemeni embassy in Washington said, “Americans should care about the Houthis.” “We need to find out a way for the Houthis and the government to co-exist … they are now a fact of life,” he told CNN. Charles Schmitz, an expert on Yemen and professor at Towson University, said the fallout from the apparent coup against Hadi was a mixed bag for the United States. “The Houthi are virulently anti-al Qaeda. They have gone after al Qaeda like no one has before. There is a certain coincidence of interest with the U.S. with the Houthis against al Qaeda,” he said. “The Houthi have done nothing to even slightly irritate the Americans. they have been very careful not to do anything like that. The Americans are very much leaving the door open.” READ: PM Valls sets out sweeping measures to safeguard France Kamran Bokhari, an adviser on Middle Eastern and South Asian Affairs for Stratfor, a global intelligence and advisory firm, said that the Houthi movement could not be ignored. “It is not clear to me to what extent Washington has relations with the Houthi movement. But now effectively the Houthis are kingmakers. While they do not dominate Yemen, they control the largest piece of real estate and they are the single-largest group,” Bokhari said. The level of Iran’s support for the Houthi movement, beyond rhetorical backing is in question. Tehran’s intelligence resources are already stretched by the Syrian crisis and its finances have been hampered by western nuclear sanctions and the fall in the price of oil. Iran, however, has spent years spreading its influence throughout the region in its wider proxy battle with its rival Saudi Arabia, an important U.S. ally, and now sponsors or heavily influences governments or key political forces in Damascus, Beirut and Baghdad, as well as Sanaa. The complex web of tribal and sectarian forces scrambling alliances and traditional alliances in Yemen represent the region in microcosm and reflects massive challenges facing U.S. officials in search of a working policy. “We don’t have a lot of leverage in there at the moment,” Seche said. “There are so many forces and counter forces at play – none of which we or anyone controls effectively,” he said. “There are currents and issues and long standing hostility they are going to have to work themselves to some extent.” As violence flares, 7 things to know about Yemen",7707,Stephen Collinson,0.103,0.794,0.103,-0.8594
195,195,01/22/2015,https://www.cnn.com/2015/01/22/politics/bill-clinton-sports-glory-days/index.html,Bill Clinton relives his athletic glory days,Politics,CNN,"Bill Clinton has had a number of glory days since he played church league basketball in Arkansas. But in an interview on Thursday, the former president reminisced about the unexpected high point in his athletic life. Clinton called into the Mike & Mike show on ESPN Radio to talk about Humana Challenge PGA Tour event this weekend in California. The event is partly run by the Clinton Foundation and coincides with a Clinton foundation summit on personal health. But the hosts, Mike Greenberg and Mike Golic, got the former president to talk about that time he “almost” dunked a basketball in a church league game. “I was in a church league. I wasn’t very good, I was too heavy. But I would run pretty well in short distances,” Clinton said. “One night I was the leading scorer on our team. I scored 16 points in a church league game, never have before or since.” He then added, “And I nearly dunked a ball! And I was only, at the time, six feet tall. I don’t know what happened. It was just one of those magical nights. My hand got like right at the rim and I almost got the ball dunked in. I figured maybe every human being on earth is granted one good day in a sports game.” Clinton has long been an avid sports fan and has remarked in the past that he watched more games while his wife, Hillary Clinton, was traveling for work as secretary of state. While in the White House, Clinton also had the opportunity – as all presidents do – to congratulate and meet championship teams from the major U.S. sports leagues, something, he said, he “really, really enjoyed.” “I had incredible encounters with some of the athletes that would say hilarious things to me,” Clinton said remembering those meetings. “One football team, and I won’t say with one, one of their greatest defensive players through his massive arm around me and he said, ‘I may be the only person here who voted for you.’ I loved it.” Clinton was also an avid golfer in the White House and recently took to defending President Barack Obama against heat he occasionally takes for golfing. The former president said the most star struck he was on the course was when he played two rounds with Jack Nicklaus, a legendary golfer with 18 career major wins. “We played this one par 5 hole,” Clinton remembered. “And I out drove Jack Nicklaus by a foot. He looks at me and I could tell he didn’t like it.” He continued: “We were both on this par 5 hole in 2 [shots] and I was only eight feet away from an eagle. I had never had an eagle on a par 5 hole. Ever. And I literally stubbed the putt. It was the worst put you could have imagined. Jack Nicholas looked at me and said, ‘You didn’t think you were worthy of an eagle, did you?’ I said, ‘I guess not.’ He smiled and he said, ‘You need to get over that.’ I’ll never forget that for as long as I live.”",2813,Dan Merica,0.014,0.828,0.158,0.9979

On Thursday, House Oversight Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz and the committee’s top Democrat, Rep. Elijah Cummings, sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia Burwell outlining their concerns. READ: Top health official involved with Obamacare resigns According to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN, “The committee is concerned … that sensitive consumer information submitted by visitors to HealthCare.gov – such as age, income and smoking habits – is being shared.” The website is the online portal many consumers use to buy health insurance through a government marketplace. The letter cited an Associated Press story published on Tuesday that reported the HealthCare.gov website is “quietly sending consumers’ personal data to private companies that specialize in advertising and analyzing Internet data for performance and marketing.” The story said the data’s scope and how it might be used was unclear, noting “there is no evidence that personal data has been misused.” SEE ALSO: What didn’t make the State of the Union? In the letter, Chaffetz, Cummings and three other committee members ask Burwell for information regarding “the scope of the information that has been shared, as well as the controls in place to protect the personally identifiable information of consumers.” The lawmakers also asked the department to identify all of the third parties that HealthCare.gov shares sensitive information with and include: what data is shared, how the data’s use is restricted and what controls exist to ensure it’s not used commercially. A HealthCare.gov official said it’s common for consumer websites to use private sector tools. HealthCare.gov uses them to streamline the user experience and respond to problems. “Protecting consumers’ privacy is a top priority. There is no evidence that consumer information has been misused by any third party,” said HHS spokesman Aaron Albright. “Unlike many retail sites similar to HealthCare.gov, we do not and will not sell a visitor’s information. We will remain vigilant and will continue to focus on what more we can do to keep consumers’ personal information secure.”",2430,Chris Frates,0.035,0.881,0.083,0.93

Co-hosted by Citizens United and Rep. Steve King – a Republican lawmaker from Iowa with strong clout in social conservative circles – the Iowa Freedom Summit will feature speeches by close to 10 potential Republican presidential candidates. Bryan Lanza, a spokesman for Citizens United, said the group invited Romney on Jan. 9, the same day the 2012 GOP nominee told donors that he’s seriously considering a third run for president. The aide said Romney will be spending time with family this weekend. RELATED: Romney, Bush to meet in Utah Romney confirmed last Friday night in a speech at the Republican National Committee’s winter meeting that he’s mulling another bid, but he offered no time frame of when he’ll make his decision. Saturday’s event will feature a full slate of potential 2016 contenders, including New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Sen. Ted Cruz, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, renowned neurosurgeon Ben Carson, and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who’s made steps towards launching a presidential bid, declined an invitation to the event, citing a scheduling conflict, while Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, another possible 2016 candidate, will huddle with donors and supporters at a retreat in Miami Beach. While Romney was initially declared the winner of the 2012 Iowa caucuses, a certified vote count released weeks later named Santorum the winner by a razor-thin margin of 34 votes.",1626,Ashley Killough,0.025,0.885,0.089,0.9578

The roughly 12-hour outage came after a “network router experienced a hardware failure,” the Sergeant-at-Arms’s office explained in an email to Senate staffers. There was no evidence of any wrongdoing. The office told staffers that technicians completed repairs early this morning, but are still testing services to ensure they are fully functional. Four Senate staffers confirmed their emails were down on Wednesday evening and they were having trouble accessing some Senate websites, but they did not know what caused the outage. One Senate staffer told CNN that email systems in his office went down at around 5:20 p.m. “It seems likely that that’s not just some routine maintenance,” he said, adding that he had not received any updates from the Sergeant-at-Arms office nor had he heard from the Capitol Hill Police Department. At about 9:06 p.m., the Sergeant-at-Arms tweeted that the issue had been identified and engineers were working on a fix.",1130,Jeremy Diamond,0.028,0.946,0.026,-0.1027

The number of fighters killed has not been publicly discussed before but was disclosed by the U.S. ambassador to Iraq Stuart Jones, who told Al Arabiya television earlier in the day that an estimated 6,000 fighters have been killed. Jones said the military effort was having a “devastating” impact on ISIS. The estimate was calculated by U.S. Central Command and finds ISIS fighters have been killed in Iraq and Syria by coalition airstrikes, according to a U.S. military official. CENTCOM has kept a running estimate of fighters killed, but has not made it public. U.S. intelligence estimates that ISIS has a total force of somewhere between 9,000 to 18,000 fighters. However, it is also believed the group can draw on thousands of other fighters whose loyalty shifts and could muster a force upwards of 31,000 total. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, would not confirm the 6,000 deaths estimate, instead saying “thousands” have been killed. On whether the body count is a sign of progress, Hagel said, “It’s a measure but I don’t think it’s the measure.” “I was in a war where we did body counts and we lost that one,” Hagel said, referring to his service in Vietnam. Until now, the Pentagon has stayed away discussing the matter, other than to estimate that thousands of fighters may have been killed. Speaking to reporters Thursday, Rear Admiral John Kirby was adamant that the US is not keeping a “body count,” and said it would be wrong to state that there is such a count. He called it a ‘tally” and said the notion of a body count suggests Vietnam War era statistics. In that war the Pentagon offered body counts as a measure of its success against the Viet Cong. Kirby said the tally was not aimed at showing any metric of success against ISIS. All of this comes after Iraq has criticized the U.S. for not doing enough to help their fight against ISIS. The U.S. has long said airstrikes are aimed at degrading ISIS as a threat, but would not by themselves get rid of the organization. Secretary of State Kerry, speaking to reporters in London, echoed the U.S. ambassador in saying the strikes have “halted” ISIS momentum, and reclaimed “more than 700 square kilometers” from ISIS in Iraq. In Iraq, airstrikes around Mosul have been stepped up significantly in support of Peshmerga fighters on the advance in the region. The effort now is to cut a key ISIS supply line into Mosul, a US military official said. The official stressed the US cannot confirm the exact number but has based its calculation based on pilot reports, and other intelligence gathered about a target before and after a strike.",2764,Barbara Starr,0.178,0.746,0.077,-0.9956
