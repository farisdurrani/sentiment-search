"I'm Will Rollins, and I'm running for Congress because America needs a new generation of leaders who will fight corruption, keep government out of our bedrooms, and protect our communities from extremism.

In Congress, I will continue fighting against extremism and corruption and work to: 

 - Pass a new law guaranteeing a woman's right to abortion. Women and their doctors should make these personal health decisions, not politicians.

 - Ban Members of Congress and their spouses from trading stocks, restrict the revolving door of lobbyists working in the Capitol, and end dark money and corporate campaign contributions.

 - Stop price-gouging by massive oil corporations and Big Pharma and lower costs for working families and seniors.

 - Keep our communities safe with violent criminal history and mental health background checks on gun sales.

Let's end the toxic divisions promoted by extremism and start solving problems.

We’re Rebecca Ballhaus and Brody Mullins, Wall Street Journal reporters on the Capital Assets [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-officials-invest-in-companies-their-agencies-oversee-11665489653) investigation. We found thousands of executive-branch officials reported owning or trading stocks in companies whose fates were directly affected by their agencies. They include a top EPA official who reported purchases of oil and gas stocks and an FDA official who owned dozens of food and drug stocks on the agency’s no-buy list.

Our investigation showed how senior FTC officials traded more than those at any other major US agency [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-regulators-of-facebook-google-and-amazon-also-invest-in-the-companies-stocks-11665670207), how dozens of federal officials reported frequent trades –in one case, 9,500 in a single year link and how top officials working on the government’s Covid response made well-timed trades [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-washington-officials-stocks-trading-markets-stimulus-11666192404) when the pandemic began–both as the markets plunged and as they rallied.

U.S. law prohibits federal officials from working on any matter that could significantly affect their personal finances, but there are many loopholes [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-1-million-amazon-conflict-washingtons-ethics-czars-struggle-to-enforce-stock-trading-laws-11666360815)—and the consequences of this investigation are yet to be seen. 

We’ll be answering questions live starting at 2pm ET, so ask us anything.

"I'm Will Rollins, and I'm running for Congress because America needs a new generation of leaders who will fight corruption, keep government out of our bedrooms, and protect our communities from extremism.

In Congress, I will continue fighting against extremism and corruption and work to: 

 - Pass a new law guaranteeing a woman's right to abortion. Women and their doctors should make these personal health decisions, not politicians.

 - Ban Members of Congress and their spouses from trading stocks, restrict the revolving door of lobbyists working in the Capitol, and end dark money and corporate campaign contributions.

 - Stop price-gouging by massive oil corporations and Big Pharma and lower costs for working families and seniors.

 - Keep our communities safe with violent criminal history and mental health background checks on gun sales.

Let's end the toxic divisions promoted by extremism and start solving problems.

We’re Rebecca Ballhaus and Brody Mullins, Wall Street Journal reporters on the Capital Assets [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/government-officials-invest-in-companies-their-agencies-oversee-11665489653) investigation. We found thousands of executive-branch officials reported owning or trading stocks in companies whose fates were directly affected by their agencies. They include a top EPA official who reported purchases of oil and gas stocks and an FDA official who owned dozens of food and drug stocks on the agency’s no-buy list.

Our investigation showed how senior FTC officials traded more than those at any other major US agency [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-regulators-of-facebook-google-and-amazon-also-invest-in-the-companies-stocks-11665670207), how dozens of federal officials reported frequent trades –in one case, 9,500 in a single year link and how top officials working on the government’s Covid response made well-timed trades [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-washington-officials-stocks-trading-markets-stimulus-11666192404) when the pandemic began–both as the markets plunged and as they rallied.

U.S. law prohibits federal officials from working on any matter that could significantly affect their personal finances, but there are many loopholes [link](https://www.wsj.com/articles/the-1-million-amazon-conflict-washingtons-ethics-czars-struggle-to-enforce-stock-trading-laws-11666360815)—and the consequences of this investigation are yet to be seen. 

We’ll be answering questions live starting at 2pm ET, so ask us anything.

##Rules

The aim of this contest is to correctly guess which political party will win the popular vote in each of these districts, senate seats, and governorships.

For each election, you will receive 1 point if your guess is correct. You will not lose points for guessing incorrectly.

There is also a tiebreakers section, so make sure to make predictions for those situations too.

If there is still a tie between those who place in the Top 10, the list randomizer at random.org will decide the final order of the top 10 tied participants.

Fill out the google form here: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1ytK9Wig4fISMKros4gQO9sNDvKcIrrlch9x6NX6eWwA

There is a limit of one entry per reddit account. 

**You will have the option to change your guess at anytime before the contest closes, but only if you use the ""edit your response"" link at the end after submitting. Save that URL!**

##Important Dates

Entries will not be accepted after **NOVEMBER 8, 2022 @ 3:00AM Eastern / 12:00AM Pacific / 8:00AM UTC**
